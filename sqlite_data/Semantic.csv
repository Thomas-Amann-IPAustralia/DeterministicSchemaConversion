### What is it?

If you disagree with an examination decision by IP Australia, there are multiple ways to challenge the decision.  

**Opposition and hearing process within IP Australia** 

You can request a 'hearing' to present your case to a hearing officer at IP Australia. You can choose to be heard on paper through written submissions, or have an oral hearing on the phone, video or in-person. A hearing officer reviews your arguments and evidence and then issues a written decision. 

A hearing keeps the matter within IP Australia and results in a formal decision you can accept or challenge further. 

**Challenging a decision made by IP Australia outside of IP Australia** 

If you prefer a decision outside IP Australia, you can appeal to the Federal Court of Australia (FCA). For some trade marks, designs and plant breeder's rights matters, you can also use the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (FCFCOA, Division 2).  

In some cases, you may seek a 'merits review' by the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART). The Tribunal takes a fresh look at the facts, law and policy and can confirm, change or make a new decision. Patent appeals go to the Federal Court. Court appeals are usually heard *de novo*, meaning the court re-hears the matter and can consider new evidence. 

Another pathway is judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Judicial review focuses on whether there was a legal error in how the decision was made; it does not re-hear the facts. 

Which path applies depends on your IP right and the type of decision. Your decision letter usually lists your options, deadlines and how to apply. You may wish to get help from a legal professional who works in IP.",,"What are the ways to challenge a decision IP Australia has made?

**The Toyota story:** ***What can SMEs learn from Toyota's approach to counterfeit products?***

![An image comparing a counterfeit auto part and a genuine Toyota brand auto part](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Picture3.png)

What can businesses do to protect themselves against importation of counterfeits that might jeopardise their brand and their products? The story of Toyota provides insight into their use of the [Australian Border Force's (ABF) Notice of Objection scheme](https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/Pages/notices/intellectual-property.aspx#:~:text=A%20Notice%20of%20Objection%20is,a%20valid%20Notice%20of%20Objection.).

The Toyota brand prides itself on having a reputation of quality and reliability among Australian drivers, with its vehicles being a common sight on roads across the country. The company's track record in quality and customer service has helped earn it a loyal customer base, [with a market share of 19.5% in Australia and a new sales record in 2024](https://www.drive.com.au/news/toyota-annual-sales-record-2024-australia/).

However, counterfeit vehicle parts pose a challenge to public safety and to Toyota's brand integrity. According to INTERPOL, counterfeit auto parts--including brake pads, airbags, and filters--are ""[often substandard, causing health problems and injuries, even proving fatal.](https://www.interpol.int/en/Crimes/Illicit-goods/Illicit-goods-the-issues) ""

The infiltration of such parts into the Australian market has far-reaching consequences--undermining consumer trust, jeopardising driver safety, and eroding the standards Toyota strives for. That's why Toyota proactively collaborates with the ABF using one of the options open to brands to combat the circulation of counterfeit products.

**The role of IP in fighting counterfeits**

Intellectual property (IP), particularly trade marks and copyright, plays a critical role for Toyota's in protecting its brand and reputation. The unique Toyota branding, including the word Toyota and its emblem, prevents consumer confusion by ensuring that products bearing the Toyota brand originate from authorised sources and meet Toyota's quality standards. When consumers see the Toyota logo, they know what they are getting.

But when these rights are infringed, the risk extends beyond brand damage. Counterfeit parts that misuse Toyota's branding can deceive consumers and introduce serious safety hazards, particularly when critical components are involved.

IP enforcement is therefore both a commercial and consumer protection priority. It provides the legal basis for identifying and removing fake goods from the market, helping ensure that consumers can have confidence in their purchase of Toyota goods.

**Toyota's use of the Notice of Objection scheme**

![Toyota and ABF officers participating in an IP Enforcement workshop hosted by the ABF (image supplied by the ABF)](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/workshop.png)

*Toyota and ABF officers participating in an IP Enforcement workshop hosted by the ABF (image supplied by the ABF)*

Toyota's journey in protecting its IP rights begins with the detection of infringements. The company actively gathers intelligence on counterfeit products through a range of channels. One of the major sources of detection information comes from the ABF through its Notice of Objection Scheme.

The scheme allows the ABF to engage Toyota's commercial information to identify counterfeit from legitimate products. Toyota's IP assists the ABF in the identification and seizure of counterfeit goods at the point of import, preventing dangerous and unauthorised products from reaching Australian consumers.

The scheme has been particularly useful for:

* Intercepting counterfeit goods at the border and safeguarding consumers from unauthorised imports falsely marketed as ""Toyota"" products, which can potentially compromise consumer safety and the integrity of their vehicles.
* Understanding unlawful importation trends concerning parts and accessories. Without a Notice of Objection in place, Toyota may not be aware of the existence of these products in the market. For example, through a notice of seizure, Toyota became aware of the importation of counterfeit products such as fake airbags and steering wheels.
* Performing testing on product imitation to analyse counterfeit products and understand risks associated with using fake parts. From time to time, Toyota requests a sample of a fake part from the ABF seizure before they are forfeited for physical verification. This verification process allows Toyota to learn more about these fake parts and compare them side by side with genuine Toyota products.
* Obtaining available information from ABF should Toyota commence a legal action -- Toyota may choose to institute a court proceeding against the importer of counterfeit products when the importer makes a claim for release of seized products. However, Toyota is committed to taking genuine steps to resolve disputes before commencing a legal action.

ABF have consistently demonstrated a high level of expertise in identifying and intercepting unlawful goods, allowing Toyota to detect fake ""Toyota"" parts and accessories before they enter the market. However, as outlined above, the benefits of using the Scheme can go beyond physical interception of counterfeit products, providing additional information about trends in unlawful importation, looks and quality of fake products, and identity of the entities involved.

The insights and evaluations obtained from border seizures further enhance the collaborative efforts of Toyota and ABF to identify and prevent counterfeit products from entering the market. For example, Toyota's Brand Protection team has been a regular participant in IP Enforcement Workshops hosted by the ABF in different ports across the country to provide latest information and training on counterfeit products to ABF officers.

However, counterfeit parts are getting increasingly sophisticated. They can look similar in appearance to the genuine products. In some cases, they are indistinguishable to the naked eye. Therefore, other brand protection strategies and mechanisms are implemented by Toyota to assist with a comprehensive approach to brand protection.

**One tool among many in the IP enforcement portfolio**

![ABF officers inspecting automobile parts in an IP Enforcement workshop hosted by the ABF (image supplied by the ABF)](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/workshop2.png)

*ABF officers inspecting automobile parts in an IP Enforcement workshop hosted by the ABF (image supplied by the ABF)*

When suspected counterfeit products are seized, both the importer and Toyota are notified of the seizure in writing by the ABF. If the importer makes a claim for release of seized goods within ten working days of notification, Toyota will be notified and will also have ten working days to commence a legal action.

However, Toyota aims to adopt a legal, proportionate, and commercially pragmatic approach to their enforcement of their IP. Their enforcement strategy may include:

* Verifying Toyota's IP rights relevant to the alleged infringement
* Legal assessment of the infringing conduct against the legislative framework
* Engaging in correspondence and negotiation with the infringing party's legal representation.

**Outcome and finalisation**

Toyota's use of the Notice of Objection Scheme shows the way in which businesses can work with the ABF, for a mutually beneficial outcome, to stop counterfeit products entering the Australian market. This mechanism also highlights how IP protection can prevent the circulation of low-quality counterfeit products that might otherwise jeopardise public health and safety.

Toyota's approach also highlights how IP enforcement may involve a range of different options as part of a comprehensive proactive approach to IP.",,"The Toyota story: What can SMEs learn from Toyota’s approach to counterfeit products?

### What is it?

You may consider developing a comprehensive, a forward-looking intellectual property (IP) strategy that may help you take proactive steps to secure, manage and enforce your IP. An IP strategy brings together your commercial goals with practical actions such as registering key rights, monitoring registries and market competitors' IP, and planning responses should you experience suspected copying in the future. 

By mapping this out early, you may avoid making important decisions under pressure, reduce legal risks and place your business in a stronger position to grow or defend your IP assets. 

An IP strategy can be formal or simple: anything from a one-page checklist to a detailed policy covering multiple types of IP such as patents, trade marks, designs, plant breeders' right and copyright. 

Key elements often include: 

* Identifying what IP assets you already have or intend to create.
* Choosing the best protection tools (e.g. trade mark registration or using non-disclosure agreements and contracts to protect your IP assets).
* Setting reminders for renewals and annual reviews.
* Deciding how you will monitor the market for suspected infringement.
* Outlining who will act and what budget is available if enforcement is needed.

If the overall visual impression of the suspected infringing design is substantially similar to the registered design, it may be considered infringemen
### What do registered designs protect?

In Australia, new and distinctive designs are afforded protection with owners registering with IP Australia.3 A registered design protects the visual appearance of a product.4 The law protects visual features such as shape, configuration, pattern, or ornamentation.5 It does not protect how the product works or what it is made from.6 Designs are tied to physical products that have a tangible form.7 Products must also be manufactured or handmade and are produced on a commercial scale.8 For example, the shape of a bottle, the pattern on fabric, or the combined features of shape and patterns on furniture.

**Protecting a design involves a two-part process.** To gain the legal right to take action against someone who uses a design without permission, owners must first register and then certify it with IP Australia. In Australia, this two-part process to apply for a design right is crucial to enforce the right against another person. See more information here '[How to apply for a design right](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/design-rights/how-to-apply-for-a-design-right) '.

When it comes to design infringement, it is essential to understand what a registered design protects. 

**Designs are tied to specific products**. Designs are registered for a particular product (like ""a chair"" or ""a bottle""). Protection only covers the appearance of that product. If someone uses the exact design on a completely different product, this may not be infringement. For example, a chair design is used as a pattern on a t-shirt.

**What is shown with the registered design is what is protected**. The images and descriptions of a registered design define what is protected. Registration not only protects the design but also designs that are substantially similar. However, it does not protect every possible variation. Additionally, if a unique feature is not clearly shown or described, it may not be protected.",,"Design infringement

### How does design infringement happen?

Where a design is registered and certified with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:

**1. Someone****uses****the design**

Australian law gives designers exclusive control over their registered designs.9 Infringement occurs when a person uses a design that closely resembles a registered design in a way that only the owner is allowed to do so and without permission.10 Someone uses a design when:

* Making or offering to make a product with the design11
* Importing a product with the design for sale or business use12
* Selling, hiring, or disposing of a product with the design13
* Using a product with the design for business purposes14
* Keeping a product with the design for sale or business use.15

**2. Someone uses a design that is similar to a registered design**

Infringement occurs when someone uses a design that looks too similar to a registered design. When looking at possible infringement, courts compare the registered design with the suspected infringing design.16 This comparison requires consideration of multiple factors. They consider:

* **The overall look**. Does the infringing design give the same overall impression as the registered design?17
* **Focus on similarities between the designs.** Attention is paid to what is similar than what is different.18
* **What a familiar person would think**. A familiar person is someone who is familiar with the product and similar products.19 They consider whether someone familiar with these types of products thinks they look too similar.
* **The field for prior designs.** If the registered design is more innovative and distinct from existing designs, common features between the design and the infringing design would support a finding of infringement. On the other hand, if the registered design is only slightly different from existing designs, small differences between the registered design and the infringing design support a finding of no infringement.20
* **Common features**. Features that are common in many similar products are given less importance.21
* **Design options**. Courts will consider how many different ways a designer could create a design for the product.22
* **Statement of Newness and Distinctiveness**. A registered design can include a statement that highlights the new and distinctive aspects of a design, helping to focus protection on crucial elements. Comparisons between designs will then focus on these features.23",,"Design infringement

### Examples of design infringement

![Three lines drawings of different chairs.](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Designs%20Example%20Chairs.png)

**For example,** a furniture company registers a design for a distinctive chair *(Chair A)* with a unique curved backrest and armrests that flow into the seat in one continuous line. 

*Might be an infringement*: Another company makes a chair *(Chair B)* with the same flowing lines from armrests to seat, differing only in size and materials.

*Probably not infringement*: Another company makes a chair *(Chair C)* with a similar seat but completely different backrest and arms. 

![Three line drawings of distinctive bottles.](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Designs%20Example%20Bottles.png)

**For example,** a soft drink company registers a design for a bottle *(Bottle A)* with a distinctive hourglass shape and textured surface. 

*Might be infringement*: A competitor makes a bottle *(Bottle B)* with a very similar hourglass shape and a slightly different but recognisably similar texture. 

*Probably not infringement*: A competitor makes a bottle *(Bottle C)* with a completely different shape but uses a texture that is somewhat similar.",,"Design infringement

### What is not design infringement

It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The *Designs Act 2003* provides several situations where a registered design is not infringed, including:

* **Prior use defence.** If the suspected infringing design was already being used in Australia before the registered design, the design may continue to be used.24

* **Repairs and spare parts:** In certain circumstances, using a design to repair a complex product may not be infringement.25 This defence recognises the practical need for replacement parts.

Navigating design infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. The scope of protection, the similarity between designs and available defences can all affect the outcome. Additionally, for infringement to occur, the registered design must be legally valid. Registered designs can be re-examined by IP Australia or challenged in court if, for example, it is not new or distinctive. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

### What is it?

If you haven't already done so, registering your trade mark with IP Australia can help you respond to suspected copying or infringement. 

Registration establishes ownership and exclusive rights, giving you stronger legal grounds to take action against current and future infringers. 

A trade mark identifies your unique brand, product or service from other competitors. It might be a logo, phrase, word, letter, colour, sound, smell, picture, movement, aspect of packaging or any combination of these. 

You might have some rights to protect your trade mark even if it's not registered with IP Australia. However, trade mark registration makes enforcing your trade mark easier and increases your enforcement options.",,"Register your unregistered trade mark

### What are the benefits?

Registering a trade mark offers a range of benefits which can simplify the enforcement process. It provides: 

* Exclusive legal rights to use the trade mark commercially (on the goods and services claimed).
* Robust and universally recognised registration (within Australia).
* Clear evidence of ownership date to support your claims.
* Strong negotiating position for settlement discussions.

Some enforcement options are only available if your trade mark is registered. These include the ability to take action against infringement under the *Trade Marks 1995*, and the ability to lodge an objection to imports of trade mark-infringing goods at the border under the Australian Border Force (ABF) Notice of Objection scheme. 

Registration can also make it easier to commercialise and licence your trade mark, and for others to be aware that you claim the rights. Your trade mark will appear on a public, searchable database showing your claim and its scope.",,"Register your unregistered trade mark

* Registering your trade mark requires an upfront fee that must be paid **before** the trade mark is examined. This fee is for the *examination* of the trade mark and is therefore **non-refundable** if the trade mark is not registrable.
* Applications to register a trade mark are generally public (an exception is TM Headstart). Your competitors might become aware you are trying to register your trade mark. They may take actions like trying to register their own similar trade mark, or oppose your application.
* You might discover that there is a problem with your trade mark, or that someone else has already registered a similar trade mark. This could mean you need to reconsider whether your trade mark is right for you.

### What might the costs be?

There are two main ways to apply to register a trade mark in Australia:

* standard application
* TM Headstart.

These have different costs and timeframes. 

**TM Headstart fees** 

Registering a trade mark through [TM Headstart](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/how-to-apply-for-a-trade-mark/pre-application-service-tm-headstart)  costs a minimum of $330. This covers submitting your pre-application (step 1), and finalising your application (step 3). If you need to make changes before finalising your application (step 2), this will add to your cost. 

| **Action** | **Fees (per class)** |
| --- | --- |
| Step 1 - TM Headstart request | $200 |
| Step 2 - Amendments to an application (optional)             Change of trade mark representation (optional) | $150 |
| Step 2 - Amendments to an application (optional)            Addition of new classes (optional) | $200 |
| Step 3 - Conversion to a standard application (Part 2 fee) | $130 |

**Standard application fees** 

A standard trade mark application costs a minimum of $250. \
 \
Your fees will be lower if you use the [picklist](https://tmgns.search.ipaustralia.gov.au/). The picklist is a searchable list of 60,000+ goods and services categorised into 45 classes relevant to trade marks. This helps examiners to know exactly which goods the trade mark is intended to apply.

### What is it?

Intellectual property is a type of property, just like a house or a car. The only difference is that you can't touch it -- It's intangible.  

Like any property, intellectual property can be bought, sold, or rented (called 'licensing' when referring to IP). 

Here are some examples of what you may choose to do: 

* Let other people use it, either for a fee (called 'licensing') or for no cost.
* Set rules around how it's used. For example, you can set rules on how it can be used only in certain places, on certain types of products, or in certain ways.
* You can sell it on its own or as part of your business.
* Make an offer to buy someone else's IP.
* If you don't use your IP and no longer wish pay fees to IP Australia to keep it, you can let the ownership lapse.

Registered IP (such as trade marks, patents, design rights and PBR) serves as a proof of your ownership, and what that ownership covers, much like a deed to a house clearly states the boundaries. This makes it much easier for everyone to be clear about who owns an IP right. 

In all these situations, you may wish to think carefully about your business plans, and seek independent help, especially to work out the value of IP you are thinking about, and any conditions you might consider about its usage. 

Many of these actions are done through contracts with other businesses. It can be vital to get an experienced professional to help you draft the agreement - such as IP lawyers - to make sure your rights are protected and no important details are missed.",,"Can I buy, sell or license IP?

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

If you need *immediate* action on infringement while waiting for a court determination, you can request an urgent court order. These orders are rare due to their serious nature and their urgency does not give the other party time to respond. 

Urgent action can include: 

* interim injunction
* search order (*Anton Piller order*).

**Interim injunction** \
An injunction**,**in the context of an Australian IP dispute, is a court order that can: 

* Stop someone from infringing your IP rights.
* Compel them to take specific actions to prevent further infringement.
* Freeze a party's assets temporarily, to ensure they can pay should a judgment be awarded against them (sometimes called a *Mareva injunction*).

An **interim injunction** is a type of injunction which can be granted without a full hearing. It's a temporary, short-term tool to protect your IP until hearings take place.  

* Interim injunctions are rare. They are granted only where there is a serious issue to be tried and monetary damages would not be an adequate response.
* Interim injunctions are usually ordered for short periods of time, often one or two days. After this time, all involved are required to attend court to determine whether the injunction should be continued.
* When an interim injunction is issued, the infringing conduct must stop immediately, even if it hasn't yet been proven. However, if it's later found that the injunction was not justified, you may need to pay compensation.
* Seeking an interim injunction is usually the first step in a broader legal case. Court proceedings are often expensive and time consuming. Considering the complexity of any legal strategy which involves an interim injunction, a lawyer or legal professional's advice may be vital before deciding to take any court action.

**Search order** \
A search order (sometimes called an *Anton Piller order*) is a court order that provides the right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. This is primarily intended to prevent destruction of relevant evidence.  

These are only granted in narrow circumstances, including that you have a strong case, and there's sufficient evidence that important material might be destroyed.",,"Seek a court order to prevent further damage while preparing for court.

### What are the benefits?

* **Rapid cessation of infringement.**By halting any infringement immediately, you prevent further damage to your IP, such as erosion of market share or brand reputation.
* **Increased leverage in negotiations.**The court's willingness to grant an urgent injunction sends a powerful signal to the defendant, which may affect future negotiations.
* **Preservation of evidence.**An urgent injunction often comes with additional orders that can include the preservation of documents, files or infringing stock.
* **Enforceability.**There are existing mechanisms in place to ensure people comply with court orders.",,"Seek a court order to prevent further damage while preparing for court.

### What are the possible outcomes?

* If the interim injunction is granted, the defending party must cease all activity suspected of infringing.
* This can be extended throughout the trial as an 'interlocutory injunction'. If the subsequent lawsuit is ruled in your favour, the defendant might then face a final, permanent injunction.
* If the subsequent lawsuit is ruled in favour of the defendant, you may be required to compensate the defendant for lost revenue due to the interim injunction. Additionally, you may be liable for subsequent legal costs, and the defendant is free to continue their previous activities.
* If the interim injunction is not granted, the defendant can continue their activities.

### What might the costs be?

An interim injunction is often the first step in an infringement action/court process/lawsuit. 

While it is difficult to specify exact costs, the total cost of the lawsuit will likely be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. A large proportion of these costs will be legal fees for your legal counsel.",,"Seek a court order to prevent further damage while preparing for court.

### What is it?

There are many ways to address IP issues and resolve IP disputes without going to court. Before considering court, you may want to try one of these informal or administrative approaches: 

* Send a letter of demand or a Cease & Desist letter.
* Use online platform takedown mechanisms - most marketplaces or social media sites may remove offers or posts that breach IP rules once you lodge a notice.
* (For trade marks and copyright) Lodge an Australian Border Force Notice of Objection so customs officers can hold suspected infringing goods as they enter Australia.
* Start [an administrative action at IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/someone-is-using-my-ip/how-to-challenge-someone-elses-ip/opposition-and-objection-fees#fx-tabs-0-panel-0)  which can remove or narrow the other party's right.

If you would like to find out more information regarding cost, benefits, risks and possible outcomes on various enforcement pathways outside court, you can explore these options through IP First Response's [Navigator tool](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement).   

There is also a group of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes that you can consider, in order to resolve IP disputes without a court hearing. Common forms of ADR include mediation, expert determination, arbitration. 

ADR happens with the help of an independent third party and only goes ahead if everyone agrees to take part. Because ADR is private and tailored, it may suit situations where you want to keep a business relationship, control what information becomes public, or simply avoid the cost and stress of court proceedings. Outcomes may include negotiated undertakings, such as written promises to stop using the IP, or custom licence terms. 

You can engage ADR through both public providers such as the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO), or private ADR specialists. Fees are set by the provider and are usually shared between the parties. 

ADR is available for all IP rights in Australia and can be used at any stage before, during or after court action has begun, so long as both parties consent. If an agreement or arbitral award is reached, it can be recorded in writing and made enforceable.",,"How can I deal with IP issues without going to court?

### What is it?

Unjustified threats of IP infringement can disrupt your business, for example while you assess whether you can continue using the contested IP. If someone threatens to take legal action against you for infringing their Australian registered IP rights, and these threats are unjustified and received by you in Australia, you may be able to take action under Australia's 'unjustified threats' laws. Similarly, if someone threatens to take action against you in Australia for infringing copyright and these threats are unjustified, you may be able to take action under the 'groundless threats' provisions of Australian copyright law. 

 If you receive or are affected by an unjustified threat, you can start legal action and ask a court to: 

* declare the threat unjustified
* order the sender to stop making threats
* award compensation for any losses.

 Some reasons a threat might be unjustified are:  

* for registered IP rights - the accuser does not actually own a current, valid Australian IP right, and therefore is not entitled to take IP infringement action
* the alleged infringement isn't occurring because, for example: the actions you've been accused of taking would not actually infringe IP rights under Australian law.

If someone makes a threat against you, they need to be able to show that the threat was justified if you decide to start legal action against them. However, is important to note that Australian IP laws make it clear that mere notification of registration or protection of IP rights, or the mere notification of the existence of a copyright, is not by itself a threat.  

It can be difficult to know whether a notice or correspondence amounts to an unjustified threat. An IP lawyer or IP attorney may be able to advise you on whether you have received an unjustified threat.  

**It is always prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start legal action.**There are often options other than court for responding to an unjustified threat -- like writing back to the other party to clarify your position -- before you decide whether to start legal action against them. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you decide on the best way to respond.

### What are the possible outcomes?

The possible outcomes will depend on how you respond to the unjustified threat. For example, whether you try to resolve the matter by writing back to the party or decide to start legal action.  

If you decide to start legal action, possible outcomes include: 

* The parties resolve their dispute outside of court through mediation, negotiation or another alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process and stop the legal action.
* A court declares the threat unjustified and might also order the other party to stop making threats and/or pay you damages if you have suffered loss as a result of the threat.
* A court finds the threat is justified. You may be required to pay the other party's costs and could face other liabilities if it is found that you were infringing their IP rights.",,"Respond to an unjustified threat

### What might the costs be?

If you decide to start legal action and your case is not resolved outside of court, court proceedings are generally expensive as legal representation is usually involved, and they can take a long time to resolve.

### How much time might be involved?

Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes months, and sometimes years, to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, which court hears your claim, and the backlog of matters before that court. 

If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.   

Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.",,"Respond to an unjustified threat

### How much is this used?

It is common for parties to respond to letters of demand (or cease and desist letters) to dispute threats and, where appropriate, allege that they were unjustified. However, it is not very common for parties to start legal action based solely on the unjustified threats. This is because of the risk that the other party is likely to respond by making a claim of infringement. More commonly, a person might decide to make an unjustified threat counterclaim where the other party starts legal action against them.",,"Respond to an unjustified threat

### What do you need to proceed?

**Consider whether the threat is unjustified** 

A key starting point can be to check the IP right registration status of the accuser (except for copyright, which in Australia does not have a formal registration system). You can search the Australian IP registers to check whether they have a current (not pending or expired) registered IP right. For design rights, the status must be listed as 'certified' (not simply registered) before they can enforce their design. 

Review your own use of the contested IP and consider whether this might amount to infringement. 

It can be very difficult to determine whether a threat is unjustified as you will usually need to determine whether the allegations of infringement are accurate. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you with considering whether a threat is unjustified and how you might best respond. 

**Gather evidence** 

Keep evidence of the threat, including: 

* copies of the threat and any related emails or letters
* evidence of how the threat has affected (or might affect) your business.

**Consider getting help from an IP lawyer** 

Strongly consider the value of speaking to an IP lawyer. An IP lawyer can review the evidence, provide legal advice and represent you in court if the threat cannot be resolved in some other way.  

Going to court without legal representation is not advisable and, in some cases, a court will require that you have legal representation.",,"Respond to an unjustified threat

### What is it?

Many online marketplaces provide bespoke IP protection programs to help businesses protect their intellectual property by enabling them to enrol their trade marks and other IP rights on the platform. \
 \
Signing up to an online marketplace's IP protection program or their brand registry involved recording your IP with the platform before issues arise.  

Each marketplace sets its own eligibility rules. IP protection programs generally focus on trade marks and require a registered trade mark or a pending application with a recognised IP office. However, many platforms receive reports for other types of IP rights as well, and having an account set up with their IP protection program can help streamline this process. 

These programs themselves are generally free or low-cost. While different marketplaces require different types of information, you will generally be required to provide proof of ownership, product images and contact details, then wait for the platform to verify your application.",,"Inform online platforms that you have IP rights

### What is it?

Monitoring competitors' intellectual property (IP) and conducting a freedom to operate (FTO) search allows you to check whether any registered or pending rights could restrict your ability to make, use, or sell your product or service. These tools help you stay informed about relevant trade marks, patents or designs and avoid infringing on existing rights. Monitoring may be ongoing, while [Freedom to Operate (FTO) searches](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/check-your-idea-against-existing-patents) are typically done before product launch or investment decisions. 

Additionally, it should be noted that certain patent monitoring procedures are available through the IP Australia Patent Search tool ([Australian Patent Search](https://ipsearch.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents/) ). In particular, you can save a specific patent so that email updates are sent, if a new document is added to the dossier. 

You can use the search tool to identify related patents. If there is a particular area of interest, you can also set up a saved search with a variety of search terms, classification marks and other parameters. This saved search can also be set up so that email updates can be sent if a new patent that meets the criteria (that is, falls within the search parameters) is published or granted.",,"Identify and track your competitors' patents and activity

### What do you need to proceed?

* **Confirm your IP and market**: Know what product or service you want to launch or protect and in which regions (particularly given the domestic nature of IP registrations), this is particularly of relevance if you hold multiple patents or hold patents across multiple jurisdictions (as you may also want to monitor overseas registrations).
* **Gather product or brand details**: Describe your offering clearly to guide the search, particularly essential features that may differentiate your offering from the competitors. For example, you may benefit if you are able to identify the most relevant classification marks, or descriptions of your differentiating or inventive features, as it will streamline the searching process.
* **Decide on search scope**: Domestic only, or international? Patent or trade mark focused?
* **Select tools or professionals**: Choose between do it yourself search tools or paid services.
* **Understand search limitations**: Results may not be legally definitive; freedom to operate is not a guarantee that competitors and patents don't exist in that market, it is possible for patents to be missed in the search process.
* **Consider advice**: You may wish to seek an FTO opinion from a qualified IP professional.
* **Keep records**: Retain copies of search results, interpretations, and advice received.",,"Identify and track your competitors' patents and activity

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

A letter of demand, or a cease and desist letter, can be an effective way of stopping infringing behaviour and avoiding the need for legal action. You can use this letter to communicate your concerns and demands. It's often one of the first actions taken if you are satisfied that an infringement is occurring. 

An effective letter of demand will:  

* Identify your ownership of the IP right (or the other basis on which you can make a claim if you do not own the right yourself - for example, if you have an exclusive licence) and whether you are entitled to make requests to cease infringement.
* Document the infringing conduct, with written examples, if possible.
* Specify the legislation under which your IP is being protected.
* Clearly specify your demands - for example, that the party stop infringing your IP rights, return or destroy all infringing property, pay you compensation, or obtain a licence from you.
* Give a specific timeframe for the infringer to stop infringing, return all infringing property to you, or pay the requested sum.
* State that if the demands aren't met, you may take further actions to stop the infringing behaviour.

**Before sending a letter of demand, you will need to be satisfied that the other party's actions amount to infringement and it is recommended that you speak to an IP lawyer or an IP attorney. There can be serious consequences if you send a letter of demand with no basis including a risk that the party you sent the letter of demand to may sue you. IP laws include 'unjustified threat' provisions (also referred to as 'groundless threats' in copyright law) under which you might be liable to pay damages/compensation or you may be ordered to stop making the threat.**

**For more information about what constitutes an infringement, see our information on**[**what infringement can look like**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/infringement-101 ""Infringement 101 "")**.****An IP professional can help you make this assessment and draft the letter.**

**Please note that sending a letter of demand before consulting with an IP professional may result in detrimental outcomes for you and your IP right. Please consider carefully if you want to undertake this action and are fully aware of the risks involved.**  

**A letter of demand will also usually be more effective if it is sent by an IP lawyer or IP attorney on your behalf, rather than you sending it personally. However, you may want to consider the cost of obtaining this legal assistance against the monetary value of any compensation or licence fee you are seeking.**

* Often cost-effective.
* Can be quick to action but needs to be drafted very carefully.
* Reasonable likelihood of stopping infringing behaviour without the need for additional steps - 43.7% of respondents, who are patent holders, found it effective at stopping copying behaviour ([Weatherall K and Webster E (2010) 'Patent infringement in Australia: Results from a survey', *Federal Law Review*, 38, 21-70, 40](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3952303) ).

### What are the risks?

* **Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation, damages or costs and in you being ordered to stop making the threat.**
* Including unreasonably onerous and aggressive terms in your letter (for example, short time frames, demands that do not relate to the IP in question) may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply.
* Exposing yourself to the other party by contacting them might prompt the other party to take actions against you, escalating the conflict in an unwanted way. This could potentially jeopardise your own IP rights.
* For trade marks, it might also prompt the other party to apply for their own trade mark, which may then need to be opposed.
* Sending a letter of demand might give the suspected infringer time to hide or destroy evidence. This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, speak to an IP lawyer before you take any further action.",,"Demand the other party stops infringing in writing

### What are the possible outcomes?

Sending a letter of demand can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the specific circumstances.  

Some possible outcomes are: 

* The alleged infringing behaviour stops upon receipt of the letter, especially if the recipient was simply unaware of existing IP rights.
* The alleged infringer does not change their behaviour, in which case you may have to consider other enforcement options.
* Parties can engage in further correspondence disputing part or all of your claims.
* The conflict can further escalate into more serious, formal dispute settlement procedures (that is, litigation, arbitration, administrative hearings).
* The other party may not fulfil all the requirements but may be willing to participate in some form of negotiation.
* **The other party may commence proceedings challenging the validity of the IP right, or be prompted to take legal action against you (for instance if they are of the opinion that you are infringing on their rights). This could include seeking damages or compensation for unjustified threatsor an order that you stop making the threat.**",,"Demand the other party stops infringing in writing

### What might the costs be?

If you engage an IP professional to give you legal advice or draft a letter for you, you will have to pay their fees.

Fees for IP professionals vary depending on the complexity of the issues at hand and which type of IP professional you engage. Fees to draft a letter of demand generally sit between: 

* For trade marks: $1,500 to $5,000
* For patents: $1,500 to $10,000

However, you should keep in mind that before drafting a letter of demand, it would be necessary to review relevant materials to confirm whether there is a proper basis for sending the letter of demand, because sending an unjustified threat could expose you to legal action. This means that the fees will also depend on how much work may be required to establish your IP rights and to confirm that there is a proper basis for your suspicion that your IP rights are being infringed by the other party.  

Some copyright owners could explore avenues for accessing low- or no-cost legal advice. For example: 

* the Arts Law Centre of Australia (a not-for-profit independent national community legal centre for the arts) can provide advice to artists and arts organisations on queries related to their arts practice, including in relation to copyright ([www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/](http://www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/) ). Arts Law also offers a [template letter of demand](https://www.artslaw.com.au/product/copyright-infringement-letter-of-demand/)  for copyright infringement, which is free for subscribers and low cost (around $30) for non-subscribers. Arts Law can also provide advice on draft letters that use their template, or otherwise provide a referral to other lawyers who can assist in drafting a letter (though lawyer fees would apply).
* The Australian Copyright Council (an independent, not-for-profit Community Legal Service (CLS) whose affiliate members include the peak bodies for Australian writers, musicians, designers, photographers, visual artists, journalists, film makers and architects) offers eligible persons (predominantly those working in the creative industries) free written advice ([www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/](http://www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/) ).",,"Demand the other party stops infringing in writing

### How much time might be involved?

Sending a letter of demand is generally considered to be a quick and simple enforcement option.   

The amount of time required for sending a letter of demand will vary depending on the complexity of the infringement and whether you choose to engage an IP professional to act on your behalf.  

It is up to you to determine how much time the other party can take to comply with your demands laid out in the letter. It's common to request action is taken within a short period such as '10 business days'.",,"Demand the other party stops infringing in writing

### What do you need to proceed?

Understanding what constitutes IP infringement, and possible consequences of contacting a suspected infringer, can help you decide if this is the right option for you. 

It's important to get all the factual details right and evaluate the merits of your claims before you send out a letter of demand, to give yourself the best chance of success. **Making unjustified claims of IP infringement can have serious consequences. If you are found to have made an unjustified threat, you might be liable to pay damages/compensate the other party or you may be ordered to stop making the threat.**

Here are some things you might wish to check and consider before sending a letter of demand and you should consider engaging an IP lawyer or IP attorney to work through these issues with you:  

* The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where infringement occurred. For registered rights, this includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the alleged infringer has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices. For copyright, this might include checking any rules around registration in that other jurisdiction - while there is no copyright registration requirement or system in Australia, this is not the case everywhere.
* Whether the other party's conduct amounts to infringement, having regard to [what infringement looks like](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/infringement-101 ""Infringement 101 ""), to avoid making unjustified threats. For registered IP, it's worth considering the 'scope of protection' of your registered claim. For trade marks, this includes the goods or services attached to your registration, and whether the other party is offering similar goods and services. For patents, it includes whether the product or process contains all the essential features of a claim in a granted patent. For copyright, you could consider whether any exceptions or statutory licence under copyright law may apply that could have enabled the use of the material in question without your permission. For more information about copyright exceptions, see [Copyright infringement | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/copyright-infringement).

The identity and contact details of the suspected infringer. It's important to send the letter to the correct party. You might wish to consider sending correspondence by registered mail,and keeping records to show that a letter was sent to a specific address on a particular date.  If you are not sure about any of the above, then you should speak to an IP professional for help.

Before taking this action, it might also be helpful to consider your goals and potential outcomes, including: 

* Whether there any other less confrontational and more informal ways to contact the other party before sending out the letter.
* Options for outcomes that would benefit or be agreeable to everyone involved.
* Whether you will be prepared to be engaged in further correspondence, negotiation or even disputes with the other party. If you threaten to do something and do not follow through, it could be found to be an unjustified threat.",,"Demand the other party stops infringing in writing

### **Consider contacting an IP professional for advice and assistance**

It can be difficult to determine whether the other party's behaviour amounts to infringement. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you make this assessment and advise what steps would work best in your situation.  

**Please note:** Making [informal contact](/options/provide-opportunity-other-party-stop-infringing ""Provide an opportunity for the other party to stop infringing"") before consulting with an IP professional can result in detrimental outcomes for you and your IP right.

### Exercise caution before making accusations of infringement

**Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation or damages or an order that you stop making the threat. Proving infringement is an important issue that should be considered before sending a letter of demand.** 

*Before you take any action, you should consider whether you need legal or professional advice specific to your situation. It is important to know what rights you have, what remedies are open to you, and the cost and likelihood of success.

**Protect your uniqueness** 

Your name, logo, invention, or product design can be *some of your most valuable assets*. But they don't automatically get legal protection -- you often need to **register** them. While some forms of IP rights are automatically created (e.g. copyright), many other forms of IP rights require registration for legal protection and enforcement.  

We make it easier to: 

* **Own your brand** (by holding it as an intellectual property and a legal basis to enforce your right to the IP)
* **Stop copycats** (by minimising confusion between your product, brand, ideas and those of others)
* **Get funding or partners** (because your IP proves you have something valuable)

**Use the right service at the right time** 

You don't have to know everything all at once. But knowing that **IP Australia** helps you protect your ideas -- and that other agencies support your growth, staff, taxes, exports and more -- is a great starting point.",,"How does IP Australia fit in a broader business support context?

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

If you have been contacted by someone accusing you of infringing their intellectual property (IP), you can consider responding with an invitation to work out a mutually acceptable solution. You might be able to reach a resolution via written correspondence or in-person discussions without escalating to formal legal action. 

Often this contact comes in the form of a cease-and-desist or a letter of demand**.** They might request that you stop the suspected infringement and set a deadline to reply. Sometimes they might also demand compensation. For more information on a letter of demand, see IP First Response's page: [Receiving a letter of demand](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/receiving-letter-demand).

You can respond in a way that lowers the risk of conflict and explores mutually acceptable solutions, even when the other party has a valid claim to the disputed IP. This process might involve checking their specific claims, evaluating the strength of your respective positions, and inviting them to participate in a dialogue to negotiate an outcome. You can also consider obtaining legal advice from a legal professional to assess the claims made by the other party and assist you to communicate with the other party.

For more information on possible commercial solutions, see IP First Response's page: [Agree to a commercial arrangement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/agree-commercial-arrangement).

Possible expenses include:

* Professional fees for legal professionals such as lawyers or IP attorneys.
* Any agreed payment to the rights holder, such as back-dated royalties or a lump-sum settlement.
* If you decide to engage in alternative dispute resolution such as mediation, fees can range from being free, a few thousand dollars (shared between the parties) or, if the case is complex, even higher amounts.

### What you need to proceed?

Before you engage in a conversation with the other party, consider gathering:

* A copy of the cease-and-desist letter or the request, including deadlines and requested actions.
* Evidence of your product, branding or content development timeline and any prior rights you may hold.
* Documents relating to the relevant IP right's scope (for registered IP rights, this would include registration details, jurisdiction, goods or services) and the other party's claims to this IP right. For instance, you may want to check if the other party is the rightful owner of the IP that you allegedly infringed.
* Contact details for the rights holder or their representative to open dialogue.
* A confidentiality agreement template to protect commercial information during negotiations.

If you cannot reach an agreement through direct negotiations, you may consider engaging in alternative dispute resolution (ADR). This can involve processes such as mediation or arbitration, where experienced third party facilitators will assist parties to resolve a dispute: [Learn more about alternative dispute resolution](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ADR).",,"De-escalate and resolve disputes via conversation

### What is it?

Mediation is a widely used type of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process where a neutral third party, called a mediator, helps parties negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. Mediation is a flexible, straightforward and often very efficient method to resolving IP disputes.  

Mediation can be used at any stage during a dispute process. It can be a preventative method used prior to an actual dispute, where parties may have encountered a roadblock. It can also be used in early stages of disputes, when parties fail to reach a resolution on their own. Lastly, you may even engage in mediation during more formal dispute resolution processes (that is, litigation or arbitration).  

While mediation can be ordered by court, it is often a voluntary process whereby disputing parties agree to negotiate an outcome with help from a mediator. Parties can discuss the suitability of mediation as a method to resolve their IP dispute and agree to participate in the process via different ways, including communicating directly through telephone discussions, email correspondence or instructing their legal representatives to do so. 

Mediation is an attractive option for parties who:  

* place a premium on the preservation or enhancement of their relationship, for instance when parties have an existing contractual or business relationship
* seek to maintain control over the dispute settlement process, with some flexibility to shape the mediation procedures without procedural rules being imposed by others
* value confidentiality, or

want to reach a speedy settlement without damage to their reputations.  

**When is mediation not appropriate?** 

Mediation isn't for everyone. Mediation may not be suitable when:  

* one or both parties need an impartial opinion on a matter of difference, perhaps to set a precedent or to be vindicated publicly on an issue in dispute
* a party is certain that it has a straightforward case to the extent that there is no room for settlement or negotiation
* deliberate counterfeiting or piracy has occurred.",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### What are the benefits?

* Costs and duration of the process is generally quite low.
* Mediation can be conducted across different jurisdictions.
* Less adversarial than other procedures such as arbitration and court proceedings, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party by reducing emotional strain and preventing the discussions from being too heated.
* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.
* Parties can narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides.
* Offers broad, productive or creative solutions to issues.
* Confidentiality, as the details of mediation and the resulting agreements reached are not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.
* Following a mediation outcome, it is open to the parties to the mediation to take further steps between them. This can include entering into a legally binding agreement that incorporates some or all of the outcomes from the mediation, provided the parties clearly intend and agree to it.
* Other enforcement processes often expect you to have negotiated in good faith before escalating (for example, a court is likely to require mediation be attempted before hearing a case).",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### What might the costs be?

The costs of mediation will typically include: 

* Mediator's fee
* Travel expenses and venue costs (if in person, though online mediation is increasingly common)
* Administrative expenses (that is, document preparation, correspondence, etc.).

The primary cost in mediation process is the mediator's fee. The hourly rate of a mediator would differ significantly depending on the subject matter of the dispute and whether you engage a private mediator or mediation services provided by court or other public bodies.  

While the fee for [mediation by a court officer](https://www.fcfcoa.gov.au/gfl/gfl-fees)  is $650 for each attendance, a [private mediator](https://mediationsaustralia.com.au/our-fees/)  typically charges $3,500 - $4,500 or more for a day of mediation.

### What do you need to proceed?

Before you engage in mediation, you should think about whether mediation is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and what kind of mediator would suit your needs best. 

**How do I choose the right mediator?** 

It can be helpful to consider these questions when selecting a mediator to help ensure they are right for you:   

1. Would the parties like the mediator to provide a neutral evaluation of their dispute, or act as a facilitator of their negotiations?
2. What are the desirable professional qualifications and specialist experience of the mediator?
3. Is it more important for the mediator to have experience in the subject matter of the dispute, or the process of mediation itself?
4. Is more than one mediator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a mediation specialist as co-mediators?
5. Does a conflict of interest exist?

There is a wide range of mediation providers, ranging from government and public-funded bodies to private practitioners. Here's a list of directories and mediation providers that may assist you in finding a mediator you would like to engage:

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

If you need to resolve an international dispute, one option is to use the [World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/center/background.html)  ('the WIPO Center').

The WIPO Center offers a range of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services designed to resolve international and domestic disputes without going to court.

They can help parties access and navigate ADR processes. For more information about what ADR is, see IP First Response's webpage available at: [General ADR Card](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ADR).

The WIPO Center's tools and services include:

* Free information and procedural assistance services (sometimes called '[Good Offices](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/goodoffices/) ') to facilitate or submit a dispute to WIPO's ADR processes. This includes providing support throughout the parties' engagement with the ADR options.
* An [extensive global database](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/neutrals/index.html)  of mediators, arbitrators and experts, including from Australia. This includes experts from specific fields/specialties: [WIPO Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Services for Specific Sectors](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/center/specific-sectors/).
* Free [online case administration tools](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/eadr/) that allow parties to manage and resolve disputes remotely.

ADR processes offered by the WIPO Centre include: 

* [Mediation](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/mediation/index.html)
* [Arbitration](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/)
* [Expedited Arbitration](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/what-is-exp-arb.html)
* [Expert determination](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/expert-determination/)

Your dispute doesn't need to be international to use the WIPO Center, and other international dispute resolution services are available in some countries. For more information, see [IP First Response webpage on enforcing your IP overseas](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/enforce-your-ip-overseas).",,"Access international arbitration and mediation services

### What are the benefits?

While this varies depending on the ADR process used, ADR generally offers the following benefits over dispute resolution through the court system:

* Costs are lower than court proceedings - particularly in the case of complex international disputes.
* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.
* Offers broader and more creative resolution solutions.
* Confidentiality, as decisions and records are not shared with the public.
* Less confrontational, helping both parties keep things from getting heated and can help preserve business relationships.
* If a dispute spans across multiple countries, a single ADR procedure can potentially resolve all the issues in one forum, saving time, reducing costs, and minimising the risk of inconsistent outcomes. Can have binding and enforceable outcomes in the form of a settlement contract or arbitral award.
* Arbitral decisions are final and cannot be appealed, unlike court rulings, while mediated settlements typically align with both parties' interests, preventing the likelihood of further dispute.
* Globally enforceable, whereas a court decision is typically confined to the jurisdiction of the country where the court is located. Using the WIPO Center's services has the additional benefits of:
  + Procedural assistance so the process is easy to navigate and use.
  + Simplifying international disputes that involve multiple jurisdictions and languages.",,"Access international arbitration and mediation services

### What are the possible outcomes?

Outcomes of ADR will depend on the specific type of ADR processes used. Possible outcomes include:

* Parties successfully negotiating and reaching an agreement to resolve a dispute.
* A binding decision such as an arbitral award or an enforceable settlement agreement.
* Further escalation into court litigation.
* Parties may withdraw from the ADR process prior to resolution of the dispute.",,"Access international arbitration and mediation services

### What might the costs be?

Information, procedural assistance, and use of the WIPO Center's [Fee Calculator](https://amc.wipo.int/adr-fee-calculator/)  are free.

There are fees for using the ADR processes (mediation, arbitration, expedited arbitration or expert determination). Costs vary depending on the process used, the provider, the complexity of the case and the value of the dispute. There will be additional costs if you choose to engage a legal professional for advice and representation. Room hire and travel expenses may also apply, although most WIPO ADR processes can be done online.

You can use the WIPO Center's [fee calculator](https://amc.wipo.int/adr-fee-calculator/)  and read the latest [fees and costs.](https://amc.wipo.int/adr-fee-calculator/)

### How much time might be involved?

Length of the process will vary depending on factors like the type of ADR used and the nature of the dispute. ADR can be much faster than court processes.

A typical WIPO Mediation takes 3 to 4 months, while the average duration of a WIPO Expedited Arbitration has been 6 to 7 months, and of a WIPO Arbitration 14 months These processes may be completed more rapidly at the request of the parties, for instance to ensure compliance with timelines in court referrals.",,"Access international arbitration and mediation services

### Who can use this?

Anybody who is a party to a dispute. However, ADR options, including those provided by the WIPO Center, generally require engagement from both parties to the dispute. It can be easier to use their services if: 

* Parties agree to resolve their dispute through the WIPO Center -- However, the WIPO Center allows one party to initiate mediation by submitting [a unilateral request for mediation](https://www3.wipo.int/amc-forms/en/adr/unilateral-mediation).
* There is a contract in place whereby parties agree to resolve disputes through the WIPO Center.

### What is it?

You, as the owner of your IP, are responsible for enforcing your IP rights.   

However, sometimes IP infringement is accompanied by other serious issues, such as dangerous goods, serious crime, fraud and scams. In these cases, it may be appropriate to report the IP infringement to government regulators.   

This option is most relevant to counterfeit goods (where a trade mark is used on physical products). However, in some cases it will also be applicable to other types of IP infringement. 

##### **If the infringement involves IP crime**

Most IP infringement is not a criminal matter. However, under Australian law it can be a criminal offence to engage in:

* trade mark counterfeiting
* certain copyright infringements -- generally involving commercial dealings or done on a commercial scale
* plant breeder's rights infringement.

These usually become a police matter when activity is serious, for example if it poses imminent risk of public harm or is highly organised or widespread. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) focuses on taking action against organisers, major importers and wholesalers of counterfeit goods. These goods pose public safety risks and can be used to support organised crime, money laundering and cybercrime. 

Sales of counterfeit goods can be reported to [Crime Stoppers](https://crimestoppers.com.au/). If you suspect links to serious or organised crime like the above, phone 131 444 and report the matter to your local police.

##### **If the infringement involves counterfeit medicines or medical devices**

Counterfeit medicines and medical devices are particularly serious as they can cause harm to users or not work as intended. Counterfeit medical products should be reported to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) at [this page](https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/resource/forms/report-perceived-breach-or-questionable-practices).  

##### **If there is serious risk of consumer harm**

Counterfeit goods are often substandard or low quality, which can be dangerous. Some IP infringement involves making false and misleading claims. These things can harm consumers and are not allowed under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL).  

Consumer harm/issues/concerns can be reported to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) at [this page](https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/contact-us-or-report-an-issue/report-a-consumer-issue). These reports can help inform future compliance activity. Please note the ACCC does not usually resolve individual complaints.  

##### **Scams and fraudulent activity**

If your IP is being used as part of a scam or fraudulent activity (for example through email phishing activity), or if you have been the victim of a scam related to your IP rights, you can report this activity to [Product and service scams | Scamwatch](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/product-and-service-scams). 

There are a number of scams relating to managing IP rights, which is unfortunately a problem around the world. You can read more about these on IP Australia's website at [Scams related to managing IP Rights | IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/fraud-and-corruption/scams-related-to-managing-ip-rights)  and learn how to report these at [How to report fraud and corruption | IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/fraud-and-corruption/how-to-report-fraud-and-corruption). Sometimes this will also mean reporting to [Scamwatch](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/product-and-service-scams).",,"Prevent risks to public interest

### What is it?

Enforcing your intellectual property (IP) is about stopping suspected or alleged infringement and, in some cases, seeking damages. Costs usually rise with urgency, complexity and the number of parties involved. 

You need to show that you own the right and that the other party's conduct likely infringes it. That can mean searches, collecting screenshots or records, and getting expert views. Each step takes time and money. 

Legal help adds cost. Many steps use specialist lawyers or IP attorneys to provide opinions, draft letters, negotiate, prepare evidence and, if needed, file hearing or court documents. Professional time is charged, and costs can rise with the number of issues, documents and parties involved. 

Formal dispute resolution processes such as court proceedings or administrative hearings can be complex. Filing and serving documents, discovery, witness statements, expert reports and hearings all often add time and cost. Even simple-looking disputes can become detailed once evidence and procedure are involved. 

Urgency can increase cost. If you need quick orders (for example, an interlocutory injunction), the team may need to work fast and at short notice. Compressing months of tasks into days can be costly. 

Technical or cross-border issues add to the bill. Patent and design disputes can need technical experts. If the problem spans other countries, you may need local advisers, as Australian rights mainly apply in Australia. IP rights are territorial, so enforcement depends on each country's system. 

Multiple sellers and platforms multiply effort. Stopping many small sellers, listings or shipments can mean repeating steps across marketplaces and channels. That repeat work adds up because each marketplace has its own process. 

**Court cases can lead to an order that you pay some of the other side's legal costs if you lose.** This usual rule, called 'costs follow the event', is a normal feature of Australian court proceedings, and it is one reason parties seek to settle earlier. 

**Lower-cost paths exist.** Many disputes resolve through negotiation or mediation (which is a form of alternative dispute resolution, 'ADR'), including with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center or accredited mediators within Australia. These still need preparation but can be faster and less costly than going to court. The Federal Court of Australia can also order mediation that may reduce time and cost. 

Several things can influence your spend. Clear records, sensible contracts and early, calm contact can sometimes reduce effort. Having registered rights can make proof quicker and provide a stronger negotiating position.",,"Why is this so expensive?

### What does a granted patent protect?

When considering patent infringement, it is essential to understand what a granted patent protects. A patent protects any device, substance, method or process that's new, inventive and useful.1 A granted patent provides its owner with exclusive control over the invention. A patent protects the specific invention described and claimed in the patent document. This can include the particular way something is made, how it works or the specific process for doing something.

**For example,** the Cochlear implant (a device) and polymer (plastic) bank notes (a substance) are inventions that have been protected with granted patents.

The most important part of a patent document is the statement of claims, which defines exactly what the inventor is legally protecting. A patent may contain multiple claims, each of which must be directed towards the same invention. Patent claims are written clearly and concisely to define what the invention is and what it is not. Therefore, the claims set out the boundaries of what others are not allowed to copy without the owner's permission. For infringement to take place, a person must do or produce something that is specified in one or more of the patent claims.

When someone receives a granted patent in Australia, they are given legal rights to their invention for a specified period. These rights include the right to stop others from using their invention without permission.",,"Patent infringement

### How does patent infringement happen?

Where a patent is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:

**1. Someone uses the patented invention**

Australian patent law gives inventors exclusive control over their patented inventions. Infringement occurs when a person uses a patented invention in a manner that only the owner is allowed to do so without permission.2 It can happen in two ways:

**When someone directly uses the patented invention.**Use happens when someone:

* Makes or manufactures a product that uses the patented invention
* Uses the patented method or process
* Sells, offers to sell, or brings into Australia a product that uses the patented invention
* Uses a product that was made using the patented process.

**When someone helps another to infringe the patent.**This happens when someone supplies products to another person, knowing they will use those products to infringe a patent.3

**2. Someone uses an invention covered by the patent**

Infringement occurs when someone does something or produces something that includes all the features mentioned in one or more of the claims in the patent. To work out whether patent infringement has occurred, courts look at:

1. **What exactly is protected**? They first look at the ""claims"" section of the patent. Claims are typically located at the end of a patent document and contain numbered statements that describe precisely which parts of the invention are protected.
2. **Compare with the suspected product or process**. Courts examine whether the product or process includes all the essential elements described in at least one of the patent claims.
3. **Consider variations**. Even if a product is not exactly the same as what is described in the patent, it may still infringe.4 For example, if someone substitutes an inessential part with another, that is equivalent.",,"Patent infringement

### Examples of patent infringement

Acme Inc. holds a patent for a new type of solar panel that uses a specific arrangement of materials to improve efficiency. Acme has a patent granted by IP Australia. CompetitorTech begins manufacturing and selling solar panels in Australia that use the exact same arrangement of materials as described in Acme's patent claims. This is likely a direct infringement, as CompetitorTech is making and selling a product that contains all the elements of Acme's patent claims.

Hanka Robotics holds a patent for a mechanical device comprising components A, B, C, and D arranged in a specific way. RivalCorp produces a similar device using components A, B, and C. However, it includes a modified version of D that performs the same mechanical function. Even though RivalCorp's device doesn't exactly match the patent claims, it may still infringe because it performs the same function in the same way.5",,"Patent infringement

### What is not patent infringement

It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The *Patents Act 1990* provides several situations where a patent is not infringed, including:

* **Prior use.** A person will not be infringing a patent if they were using the invention before the patent was filed.6
* **Foreign vehicles passing through**. Using a patented invention on foreign ships, aircraft, or vehicles that are only temporarily in Australia does not count as infringement. So long as the invention is used only for the vehicle's own needs.7
* **Obtaining regulatory approvals.** A person will not be infringing a patent if they are using the patented invention to obtain approval for medical goods with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)8 or other regulatory approval for non-pharmaceutical goods (e.g., agricultural chemicals).9
* **Experimental use.** A person will not infringe a patent if they are experimenting with the invention,10 such as determining the properties of the invention, the legal scope of protection for the invention, improving or modifying the invention, assessing the legality of the patent, or evaluating whether the patent has been infringed.11

Navigating patent infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Experts can help work out exactly what a patent protects. They can interpret the legal language in the patent claims. Additionally, for infringement to happen, the patent must be legally valid. Patents can be challenged if, for example, the invention is not new or innovative. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

It can be very stressful when someone accuses you of IP infringement. This can be even more confusing if the allegation that you are infringing someone's intellectual property (IP) appears weak or unfounded. It is a good idea to evaluate the situation and consider your options before deciding how you might deal with the infringement allegation.

**Not taking an immediate action does not mean that you should ignore the issue. You may require some time to:**

* Assess the other party's claims and demands relating to the alleged infringement.
* Verify their identity and the validity of the rights they claim ownership of.
* Consider any evidence you may have to refute their claims.
* Consult with legal professionals, or to decide on your next steps.
* Determine whether the letter is genuine or is fraudulent.

For more information on how to assess a letter of demand (or a cease-and-desist letter), see IP First Response's page on [Receiving a letter of demand](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/receiving-letter-demand).

### What is it?

**Start by** [**matching what you have to the right IP type.**](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/tools-and-research/business-resources/choosing-the-right-ip-tool)  Brands are usually protected with trade marks, technical inventions with patents, the look of a product with designs, and new plant varieties with plant breeders' rights (PBRs). You might prefer to protect certain know-how and knowledge as trade secrets, rather than seeking registration of IP. 

**Consider timing risks and benefits.** Avoiding registration can mean someone else files first, or that public use affects your options. Registration can make it easier to act on suspected copycats and can support deals like licensing or investment. However, IP registers are publicly accessible, meaning that competitors can find information about your IP registrations or applications. 

**Check whether your idea meets the basic requirements for registration.** Below are some of the basic requirements for each registrable IP type: 

* Patents must be new and inventive compared with what is already public.
* Designs must be new and distinctive.
* Trade marks need to be capable of distinguishing your goods or services. Also, they cannot be identical or too similar to earlier trade marks that are applied for or registered in Australia.
* PBRs need a new, distinct, uniform and stable variety.

There are many other formal and legal requirements for IP to be deemed as valid or registrable. Assessing whether your IP meets all legal requirements for registration is a complex process -- It is common for people to engage professional services from IP lawyers or IP attorneys to obtain advice on this point and assistance in the overall registration process. 

**(For patents, designs, and PBRs only) Think about what has already been made public.** Showing an invention or design before you file can affect your options. Australia often allows a 12-month grace period for patents and designs, but relying on this can be risky and conditions apply. Using confidentiality agreements when testing or pitching can help you keep options open. 

**Confirm who owns it.** If employees, contractors or partners helped creating it, check contracts so the right person or business is named as the applicant. 

**Run availability and clearance checks relevant to the type of IP**: 

* Search the [Australian Trade Mark Search (ATMS)](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/quick)  and use [TM Checker](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/search-existing-trade-marks/tm-checker)  to spot lookalike brands.
* Search global patent databases for similar inventions and design databases for similar product looks.
* Search global plant variety registers if you plan to apply for PBRs.
* Do a quick web and marketplace scan to see what is already out there.

**Remember that** **IP rights are territorial, meaning that Australian registrations protect you in Australia**. Protection overseas usually needs separate applications. You may want to seek registration with national IP offices in other countries, if you are thinking of operating in overseas markets. 

**Get your evidence and documents together.** For your patent, design or PBR applications, make sure you keep dated notes and drafts, drawings or photos, and any testing results. While such 'evidence' is not required for trade mark applications, keeping note of the date you first used the brand and examples of packaging or advertising can help you down the track should your application run into an objection or opposition during the examination process. 

**Applications involve government fees and can take time to examine**. You may need to respond to objections raised by examiners, or an opposition process initiated by third parties.",,"What to check before getting registered IP

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

Taking no action when you have identified infringement is a valid and common strategic choice to consider. People choose not to actively pursue enforcement actions for several reasons including: 

* the infringer is inconsequential
* the infringement has little risk of confusing your customers
* there is low risk of damaging your brand or business
* there can be reputational risk in taking action
* the chances of successful enforcement are low compared to the costs involved.

It is important to take a holistic approach to addressing infringement which considers several factors: 

* the details of your IP rights
* your current business situation and objectives
* your personal circumstances
* the nature and potential consequences of the infringement.

It can feel very personal when someone is infringing on your intellectual property - and it is important to acknowledge any emotional response you have to the situation - but choosing to take no action (as part of a thought-out IP strategy) can be a valid and rational choice. 

It can be helpful to speak to an IP professional to help you develop an overall IP strategy, which makes it easier to decide when and how to respond to different types of infringement, as well as taking pro-active steps to prevent future infringement.

* The time, cost and labour required to take actions to prevent infringement on your IP may not be justified at this point in your business or IP journey.
* Taking no immediate action can allow you to gather evidence and time to evaluate the true risk and possible damage to your business, so you can act when the time is right.
* You can usually change your mind and pursue an action in future - you are not required to act as soon as you became aware of infringement, although delays could pose risks.
* Infringing businesses may fail or leave the market with no intervention from you.
* Choosing to avoid enforcement actions shelters you from needing to establish or defend your rights, which you may not wish to draw attention to.
* You can choose more opportune timing to take action, for example: when your business is impacted enough to warrant action, when you have gathered enough evidence to take effective action, or other practical timing issues relating to your business (like avoiding the busy season).",,"Choose not to act immediately

* The cost and energy of monitoring the infringement in an ongoing way may exceed the effort of dealing with it immediately.
* If infringement has happened and you do not take action, the infringement may be repeated by the current infringer or others also infringing.
* Allowing infringement - even that which doesn't directly damage your business - may:

### What do you need to proceed?

* Review IP First Response resources to understand all your enforcement options, even if you're not using them now. This helps you make an informed choice about waiting and know what tools are available if you change your mind later.
* Develop a clear strategy for when you *will* take future enforcement action. Your plan can outline specific triggers that will prompt you to act. These might be when the infringer:
  + Grows beyond a certain size.
  + Starts competing in your geographic area or digital space.
  + Has been infringing for a set period.
  + Crosses other meaningful boundaries for your business.
* Calculate the potential costs and timeline for different enforcement actions. This helps you budget and prepare for if you do decide to move forward.
* Identify which type of IP professional you would consult if you choose to act. Consider having initial conversations to understand their services and approach.
* Keep documentation of the infringement, including dates and evidence, to maintain a strong foundation if you choose to take action in the future.",,"Choose not to act immediately

### What is it?

Before you spend money on your name, logo or idea, it can help to check if someone already owns it. This is called an 'IP search'. 

An IP search means looking in free online tools called registers. These show who owns trade marks (names, logos), patents (inventions), designs (product looks) and domain names (website addresses). 

For: 

* **Names and logos** - Use Australian Trade Mark Search. If you already have a logo and want to check if something like it is registered, you can also use TM Checker.
* **Inventions** - Use Australian Patent Search.
* **Product designs** - Use Australian Design Search.
* **Plant breeders' rights (PBRs)** - Use Australian Plant breeder's rights search.
* **Copyright** - There's no register in Australia. Search online, in image tools, or in industry databases.
* **Website addresses** - Search the .au domain name register.

You can do a quick search yourself, but a lawyer or IP professional can do a deeper search and explain tricky results. 

**Please note:** No results doesn't mean you're safe. New rights appear often, and some rights (like unregistered trade marks) don't show in registers.",,"check if someone else already owns a word, logo OR IDEA You WANT

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

Parties involved in an IP dispute can negotiate a mutually acceptable commercial or financial agreement to resolve their dispute. While negotiation between parties often takes place as a preventative measure prior to launching a more formal action, it can also be used at any stage during a dispute process. 

Sometimes, direct negotiation may not be the best way forward to resolve an IP dispute. This is especially the case if you have a difficult relationship with the other party involved or find it challenging to communicate with them. In these cases, representatives such as lawyers are commonly sought to provide legal advice and assistance.  

Parties can propose and negotiate commercial outcomes in different ways, including communicating directly in person or through correspondence, or instructing their legal representatives to do so on their behalf.",,"Reach an agreement with the accusing party

### What are the benefits?

This option offers a lower cost, flexible and private way to resolve IP disputes. A negotiated commercial solution offers: 

* Potentially lower costs and a quicker  process, especially compared to other dispute resolution processes where you must rely on third parties (such as courts and tribunals).
* The ability to agree to a creative, productive outcome that can benefit both parties commercially.
* A much less adversarial pathway than legal procedures, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party.
* A flexible and informal approach, as it is entirely up to the parties to shape the process.
* Negotiation can be conducted across multiple jurisdictions.
* Confidentiality, as the details of negotiation and the resulting agreements reached are generally not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.",,"Reach an agreement with the accusing party

### What are the risks?

* Relies on genuine engagement and willingness of parties to resolve issues.
* If the discussion stalls or backfires, this could result in delays or lost opportunities.
* Outcomes may not be as easily enforceable as court or tribunal decisions, especially when parties have not clearly indicated that the outcome of the negotiation is to be legally binding.
* In some cases, direct contact may worsen tensions. If the other party considers that you are posing unreasonable aggressive or unprofessional terms for negotiation (not negotiating in good faith), it may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply. Some commercial arrangements may result in your intellectual property being 'diluted' by sharing the same or similar IP with others, which may cause damage to the value of your IP and make it harder to enforce it in the future.
* If not handled with caution, it is possible that you may say something that undermines your legal position, which could result in less favourable outcomes if formal action follows.",,"Reach an agreement with the accusing party

### What are the possible outcomes?

Commercial negotiations can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the parties' desires and specific circumstances. If you are able to reach an agreed outcome, this might result in: 

* A licence or co-existence arrangement,
* Selling or transferring IP ownership (called *assignment*),
* Compensation or goodwill payment,
* Franchising options, or

### What do you need to proceed?

It's important to get all the factual details right and evaluate the merits of the claims before you respond to the other party. Here are some things you might want to check and consider before talking to the other party:  

* The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where the alleged infringement occurred. This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the accuser has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices.
* The identity and contact details of the other party - it's important to make sure you speak to the correct party.

Throughout the negotiation with the other party, it can be helpful to remember to:  

* Stay calm and professional throughout the conversation, avoiding emotional, accusatory language.
* Focus on the issues at hand, not the personalities of the other parties involved.
* Acknowledge that problems are often caused by misunderstanding or oversight, and that a mutually beneficial outcome can be reached.
* Be clear on the terms of agreement you may reach with the other party, writing down the agreement in detail at the end of the conversation.

It can be difficult to determine whether you will be able to leverage a commercially meaningful outcome from the IP dispute you are facing and if you can have a productive, amicable discussion with the other party. An IP professional can help you make this assessment and advise which steps might work best in your situation.",,"Reach an agreement with the accusing party

### What is it?

As a business owner, there's a lot of information to grapple with and working out which IP options apply to you can be tricky. By matching your current activities to common stages in the IP journey, you can quickly see what's most relevant now and what might come next. 

'Where am I in the IP journey?' is a way to help pinpoint your stage in protecting and using your IP. Businesses take different IP steps depending on whether they're just starting out, developing a product, protecting it, commercialising, or expanding. 

Knowing your stage can help you focus your attention and avoid missing protections that are easier to put in place early. The IP journey often follows five broad stages: 

**1. Idea and readiness** \
You're here if you're still shaping your concept and testing whether it has real-world value. You may be: 

* Checking whether your idea is unique and protectable, such as by conducting some internet research and searching for existing [trade marks](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/search-existing-trade-marks/tm-checker), [patents](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/check-your-idea-against-existing-patents), [designs](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/designs/search/quick?_gl=1%2as1ag7s%2a_ga%2aMTExMjM3MjAxNi4xNjM1ODI2Nzc1%2a_ga_QX1TTWEZ1L%2aMTY0NDUzMTQzMy4xMjUuMS4xNjQ0NTMxNTY0LjA)  and [plant breeders' rights](https://ipsearch.ipaustralia.gov.au/pbr/)  (PBRs).
* Protecting original material with copyright (automatically created when certain conditions are met) and keeping details confidential using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) during prototype testing.
* Conducting early market research and ['freedom to operate'](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/check-your-idea-against-existing-patents) checks to identify any existing rights you might risk infringing.
* Not necessarily set up a business structure yet, secured funding, or registered any IP rights.

**2. Development** \
This is the stage where you turn an idea into something market-ready. You may be: 

* Creating prototypes or running service trials.
* Collaborating with partners, suppliers, or researchers.
* Running more detailed freedom-to-operate searches to avoid infringing others' rights.
* Deciding whether to apply for trade marks, designs, patents, or PBRs.
* Beginning to think about how registered IP could make your business more attractive to potential investors.

**3. Protection** \
Here you've started locking in your rights. You may be: 

* Applying for, or registering, relevant IP rights in Australia and any other countries you plan to use the IP.
* Understanding that Australian IP rights only apply within Australia -- protection in other countries usually requires separate applications, sometimes using agreements like the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). There is no single 'international patent' or a 'global trade mark'.
* Putting systems in place to safeguard confidential information, trade secrets, and your brand.
* Making sure your IP strategy fits your business goals and timelines.

**4. Commercialisation** \
Your IP is now part of how you make money. You may be: 

* Selling, licensing, or otherwise monetising your product or service.
* Securing IP rights before going to market to help protect your competitive position.
* Choosing your commercialisation model, such as franchising or partnering.
* Actively marketing your brand and [monitoring competitors](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/monitor-trade-mark-register-and-market-competitor-activity) for suspected infringement.
* Using registered IP to help build investor confidence in your business model.

**5. Growth and expansion** \
This stage is about scaling and staying competitive. You may be: 

* Entering new markets, in Australia or overseas, and considering IP protection in each new location -- as registered rights do not automatically extend beyond Australia.
* Managing a growing IP portfolio, including new rights for new products or services.
* Continuing research and development to keep your edge.

These stages are not always strictly linear -- you might revisit earlier steps as your business changes.",,"Discover where you are in your IP journey

### What is it?

Challenges to the registration of trade marks by IP Australia are known as oppositions. You can oppose the registration of a trade mark if you believe that an accepted trade mark would impact your existing trade mark or otherwise impact your or the public interest. Some oppositions move to a hearing, conducted by neutral experts within IP Australia. 

There are several reasons on which a trade mark application can be opposed, including (but not limited to):  

* similarity to an existing trade mark
* being too generic or descriptive
* containing a connotation that is misleading and confusing.

Opposition processes can also be used for opposing other types of IP Australia decisions such as applications for removal, advertised amendments to trade marks and certain extensions of time proposed by IP Australia. 

Objections to the registration of a trade mark can typically only be raised within 2 months of its acceptance date being published. If this period has passed, you may need to explore other options.

### What are the benefits?

* Initiating this process allows you to draw attention to factors which may have been overlooked in the examination process or other issues which may not have been allowed to be considered during examination.
* The hearing officer has the power to award *costs* against a party to help recoup some of the costs incurred by the other party during the opposition process. This does not, however, extend to any losses or damages.
* Hearing officers in IP Australia have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.
* The process is accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.
* Trade mark opposition and hearing processes are more informal and generally quicker than court proceedings in reaching an outcome.
* The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.
* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.",,"Challenge the registration of a new trade mark

### What are the risks?

* If your opposition action is unsuccessful and the trade mark is registered, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.
* When opposing the registration of a trade mark, the applicant will be notified of your opposition. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the applicant be aware of you and your business.
* Due to the public nature of this process there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to take enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy.
* There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.
* It is possible that opposing a registration of a trade mark can alert the other party to your claims and can cause them to act more defensively or even contest your own rights.
* Using this process improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.
* If you are late in providing evidence, you can request an extension to the evidence submission timeframe. However, these can be difficult to obtain. You will need to demonstrate strong grounds for the extension and pay additional fees to IP Australia when you make the request. These fees are not refundable even if the extension isn't granted.

### What are the possible outcomes?

1. The other party does not contest your opposition to their registration, and the trade mark application does not get registered.
2. The other party contests your argument and defends their application in an opposition and hearings process, resulting in:
   * achieving registration, advertised amendment or extension of time in favour of their position, or
   * your opposition being upheld, and the other party fails to achieve registration, advertised amendment or extension of time.

**Duration of process** \
The process duration varies depending on the complexity of the matter in question, how quickly each party responds and each party's strategy. Refer to some of the timeframes permitted in the image below.

Future status 'Registered' appears at bottom, indicating the next step in the process.](/sites/default/files/images/2025-03/Published%20TM.png)

Unless the period has been extended, opposition to the registration of a trade mark can typically only be raised within 2 months of its acceptance date being published. If this period has passed, you may need to explore other options. 

The status of the trade mark in the Register will be shown as 'Accepted: In opposition period' during this period. It will also contain an 'application being considered' notice above the application's timeline. Check the status of the trade mark now, and ensure that less than two months have passed from the date of acceptance from [Australian Trade Mark Search](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/quick).",,"Challenge the registration of a new trade mark

### What you need to proceed?

IP professionals are commonly used to help navigate the process and assist parties to present their cases, though it is not a requirement of IP Australia.

You can initiate an opposition process by submitting *a notice of opposition.* Doing so informs IP Australia of the potential conflict or grounds as to why the trade mark is not registrable, and gives all parties involved opportunities to present their cases and evidence, which will then enable IP Australia to decide whether or not to register the trade mark. If the opposition to registration is successful, the trade mark will not be registered.

Depending on the grounds on which you are opposing, you may need to provide documents, details or other types of supporting evidence to support your argument. More information can be found on the IP Australia website regarding the types of evidence that would help your case and formal requirements for evidence: [Evidence In Oppositions And PBR Objections | IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/someone-is-using-my-ip/how-to-challenge-someone-elses-ip/evidence-in-oppositions-and-pbr-objections).

To begin the process, log into [online services.](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip)  and select 'File an opposition'

![Screenshot of IP Australia's trade mark opposition webpage. The page shows three main sections: 'File an opposition' (showing options to file a new opposition or statement of grounds), 'Manage an opposition matter' (showing options for submission management, extensions, and withdrawal), and 'Request or attend a hearing' (showing hearing request options and cooling-off period requests).

### What is it?

Free IP tools are no-cost online services that let you look up, track and learn about intellectual property (IP) rights. They cover everything from quick trade mark checks to deep patent searches and step-by-step help guides. 

Using these tools may boost your confidence before spending money on paid databases or engaging professional help. They can help you spot obvious conflicts, confirm renewal dates or see if someone is already using a similar brand. 

Most tools work through online forms. Users can enter keywords, images or classification codes and receive instant results drawn from official registers such as Australian trade mark, patent, design and plant breeder's rights databases, or global collections like the Global Brand Database. 

Many also include learning modules, alerts or visual maps so users can keep an eye on possible competitors. Some providers (e.g. PATENTSCOPE) offer free accounts for saving searches and setting up email notifications. 

These services focus on publicly available data. Results are often limited to the scope of their own databases (e.g. IP Australia registers will only have data relating to applications submitted to IP Australia), and can be hard to interpret. If you are worried about copying, it's important to remember that only a court can confirm that infringement has occurred. It's also important to make sure that your confidential details are never be entered into public search tools. 

Here are some common tools and what they can help with: 

* **TM Checker - IP Australia**: Quickly checks if your business name or logo is similar to any registered Australian trade marks.
* **Australian Trade Mark Search - IP Australia**: Searches the full trade mark register for registered and pending marks, including word and image marks.
* **Australian Patent Search - IP Australia**: Lets you search Australian patent applications and granted patents.
* **Australian Design Search - IP Australia**: Helps you check if a design similar to yours has already been registered.
* **Australian Plant Breeder's Rights Search - IP Australia**: Lets you find out if a plant variety is protected in Australia.
* **IP First Response - IP Australia**: Helps you explore what to do next if you suspect someone is using your IP.
* **Find an IP attorney or firm - Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board:** Helps you find and contact a qualified IP attorney.
* **Global Brand Database - WIPO**: Searches trade marks registered in many countries at once.
* **PATENTSCOPE - WIPO**: Lets you search international patent applications and many national patent collections.
* **The Lens**: Combines global patent data with scientific research and innovation landscapes.",,"Free IP tools you can use

### What is it?

Using your trade mark in a uniform recognisable way helps customers link the trade mark with your goods or services and shows that you claim the brand as yours. On the other hand, not using your trade mark on the claimed goods or services following registration, or adopting a trade mark that is very different from the registered trade mark may render your trade mark vulnerable to removal from the register for non-use. 

For consistent, strategic use of your trade mark, you would need to think about the key elements that constitute the trade mark and apply these elements coherently. Having the same spelling, layout, colours and positioning across public touch-points, such as packaging and marketing materials, can help your consumers and competitors to recognise your brand and link it to your goods or services.  

Adding the 'TM' symbol for unregistered marks or the '®' symbol once registered also signals your intent to use the mark as a trade mark and a badge of origin distinguishing your goods or services from those of competitors. 

You may develop simple brand guidelines for consistent usage of your trade mark. You may provide training to your staff using these brand guidelines, and establish review processes for authorised users such as your suppliers, distributors and licensees to ensure your trade mark is being used in a manner that's consistent with your branding strategy.",,"Use your trademark prominently to build recognition and protection

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

In the context of intellectual property (IP) protection, a letter of demand (or a cease and desist letter) is a formal notice from someone who believes you are using their IP without permission. It's often the first formal step used in notifying someone of an IP issue. 

It can be shocking to receive a legal letter like this, and the emotional impact should not be underestimated. Take time to carefully read the information to ensure you understand the other business' or IP right owner's concerns. Some important things to identify are: 

* which IP right the sender claims has been used without permission ('infringed')
* what the sender wants you to do (for example, halting sales or removing content)
* what evidence the sender has given in support of their claim.

It is usually not a good idea to ignore a letter of demand without first seeking professional advice. Taking time to understand their perspective may help you decide whether to negotiate, seek advice, or contest the claim. 

**Before responding to a letter of demand, you may want to show the letter and explain the situation to a qualified** [**IP legal professional**](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/get-professional-assistance-with-your-IP)  **who can explain your position and outline possible options.**

### Common features in a letter of demand

Here are common features of these letters: 

* **Heading and sender details** -- The letter should identify who sent the letter (whether the rights holder or their representative). You may want to verify their authority and ensure the letter was addressed to the right person or business. Some useful starting points include the [Trans-Tasman IP Attorney registry](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm)  and the [ABN lookup tool](https://abr.business.gov.au/).
* **Description of the alleged infringement** -- Explains which IP rights are involved (for example trade mark number, patent number, specific item of copyright material and so on), identifies the sender's ownership of the right (or if they do not own the right themselves, it identifies the other basis on which they make the claim - for example if they have an exclusive license) and what actions you took that the sender claims infringe their IP rights.
* **Demand to stop the activity** -- Usually includes a list of things that the sender wants you to do in response to their letter, such as taking something down from a website, stopping selling a product, changing branding or marketing, or paying them compensation.
* **Deadline for compliance** -- Often includes a time limit for responding to their demands (for example, from 7 to 30 days) after which they may decide to start legal action against you.
* **Evidence or exhibits** -- May include screenshots, photos, links or documents.
* **Consequences of non-compliance** -- Often warns of possible court action, damages or injunctions. This is a common inclusion but doesn't mean legal action will immediately or definitely follow.
* **Reservation of rights** -- A general phrase keeping the sender's legal options open.
* **Contact details for discussion** -- Gives you a way to reply or negotiate.

**Note:** While you should not ignore a letter of demand, you may not need to respond to the demand immediately ([Choose not to respond immediately](/options/choose-not-respond-immediately ""Choose not to respond immediately"")), nor do you need to [personally respond](/options/de-escalate-and-resolve-disputes-informally) or simply comply to their demands . It may be advisable to [speak to an IP lawyer or IP attorney](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/obtain-legal-advice-your-situation) about the letter of demand. They can advise you on next steps and also communicate on your behalf.",,"Receiving a letter of demand

### Things to watch out for (possible scams or false claims)

Some cease and desist letters may be [misleading or sent in bad faith](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/stay-protected/checking-a-business-is-genuine). Signs that the letter may not be genuine include: 

* **No clear sender** -- The letter lacks the sender's name, firm or contact details.
* **No specific IP right mentioned** -- There is no trade mark, patent or design number, or information or evidence to support their claim of copyright.
* **Fake IP right number (for registered rights)** -- The IP right number provided is not published on the IP register (but you need to be careful to make sure you are checking the correct register).
* **Poor grammar or formatting** -- Scam letters often contain multiple typos or formatting issues.
* **Overly aggressive or urgent tone** -- Extreme threats or unrealistically short deadlines can be intimidation tactics.
* **Demands for payment to unknown accounts** -- You are asked to pay quickly to unfamiliar or overseas bank details.
* **No evidence provided** -- Genuine letters usually attach screenshots, product photos or other proof of the alleged infringement.
* **Threats about confidentiality**-- While there are often reasonable requests to keep the letter confidential, this can also be used as an intimidation tactic.

However, a letter of demand may not be a scam even if it has some of the features listed above. If you are not sure, it may be advisable to speak to an IP lawyer or IP attorney about the letter you received.",,"Receiving a letter of demand

* You ask them to negotiate or you suggest to resolve the dispute through an[alternative dispute resolution process, such as mediation](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ADR).
* You ignore the letter -- which may lead to the other party escalating the matter, such as starting legal action against you. It may not be advisable to ignore a letter of demand without first speaking to an IP lawyer or IP attorney.",,"Receiving a letter of demand

### What is it?

If you are not happy with the service you received from IP Australia, there are ways you can raise your concerns. A complaint allows you to explain what went wrong and what outcome you would like. 

Complaints are handled separately from IP decisions. Making a complaint does not replace or pause any formal review or appeal deadlines. If you want to challenge a formal decision (for example, an objection being raised for a trade mark or patent), you need to use the separate review and appeal processes available. **For more information about this process please see here:** [**What can I do if I disagree with IP Australia's examination decision? | IP Australia First Response**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/what-can-i-do-if-i-disagree-ip-australias-examination-decision).

When making a complaint, it helps if you include: 

* your name and contact details
* details of the issue, including any reference numbers
* what outcome you are hoping for (such as an explanation, correction, or apology)
* any evidence or documents that support your complaint.

IP Australia staff are required to follow the Australian Public Service (APS) Code of Conduct. This means they must behave honestly, act with care and diligence, and treat everyone with respect and courtesy. If you feel this did not happen, you may raise that in your complaint. 

You can start by contacting IP Australia directly through their online feedback form or by using the [contact channels](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/contact-us)  on their website. If you are not satisfied with the response, you may take your complaint to [the Commonwealth Ombudsman](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/complaints/how-to-make-a-complaint), who handles complaints about Australian Government agencies. The Ombudsman can review how your complaint was managed but cannot overturn IP Australia's formal decisions.",,"I'm not happy with IP Australia - what can I do?

### What is it?

Business owners have reported receiving messages from scammers that threaten others with claims of IP infringement or send unsolicited invoices pretending to be IP Australia. Spot warning signs quickly so you can decide whether to look closer or ignore the message. 

Common examples include fake renewal invoices or reminders, emails claiming to be from 'IP Australia', and 'cease and desist' threats from a pretend law firm. Scammers also send fake IP violation notices via social or marketplace platforms, or sell listing services that sound like official protection. Note that listings on non-official 'registers' don't create legal rights or protection. 

The goal is usually to rush you with claims of 'suspected' or 'alleged' infringement, to collect money or your login details. Lookalike email addresses or websites may be used, and payment requests can be unusual. 

**Treat with caution any message demanding immediate payment or urging you to click a link to 'keep your trade mark alive' or 'stop legal action'.** 

Look for these red flags: 

* The sender's email does not end with an official government domain. Official IP Australia will come from @ipaustralia.gov.au.
* The message uses a generic greeting, has spelling mistakes, or your IP details are wrong or incomplete.
* There is pressure to 'pay now' or threats of court action for 'alleged infringement' without clear case details.
* Payment is requested to an overseas account, by gift cards, or in cryptocurrency.
* Links point to a site that looks unusual or is not on a trusted government domain. Also, never click links in an unexpected email.
* The claimed 'IP attorney' or 'law firm' cannot be found on [the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board register](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm)  or a relevant law society register (e.g. [Register of Solicitors | The Law Society of NSW](https://www.lawsociety.com.au/register-of-solicitors) ) .

You can also confirm any official notice by logging into IP Australia's [Online Services](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/someone-is-using-my-ip/how-to-challenge-someone-elses-ip/opposition-hearings).  

If you suspect a scam, you may wish to report it to [Scamwatch](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/)  or [ReportCyber](https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/report), and keep any evidence such as screenshots or email headers.

### What is it?

A business may operate under several 'names', but only a registered trade mark is an intellectual property right that can give you exclusive control over your brand across Australia. IP Australia administers trade marks, while ASIC handles business and company name registration. 

**Business name** 

* Your trading name registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), so customers know who owns the business.
* It identifies your business but does not give you exclusive rights to that name. Other people can register or use a similar business name. Business name registration does not provide intellectual property protection.

**Company name** 

* A separate legal entity created under the *Corporations Act* 2001 (Cth) when you register with ASIC.
* It helps authorities and customers find the right business but does not create any brand-ownership or exclusive rights. Registering a company does not give you trade mark rights.

**Registered trade mark** 

* A sign such as words, logos, slogans or shapes, registered with IP Australia to distinguish your goods or services.
* Grants you exclusive rights nationwide to use the 'mark' for goods and services for which it is registered.
* Allows you to take legal action against suspected infringement and can deter others from copying your brand.

Because each register serves a different purpose, you can hold a business name, company name and trade mark at the same time. The registers do not cross-check, so an available business name on ASIC may conflict with an existing trade mark in IP Australia's register, and vice versa. 

Trade mark registration involves application and renewal fees, while business name registration is comparatively inexpensive. Only a trade mark can give you enforceable, nationwide rights. 

**Key point:** Registering a business name or company name does not give you intellectual property rights. Only a registered trade mark can provide exclusive legal protection for your brand.",,"Is my business name my IP?

### What is it?

**What is it?**

Having a qualified expert can help you navigate the complex system of IP enforcement. Qualified experts for IP enforcement include lawyers specialising in IP, and trade mark and patent attorneys. We refer to these experts as 'legal professionals', although trade mark and patent attorneys are not necessarily lawyers and may not be qualified to engage in legal practice.

Depending on your situation, it may be necessary to seek advice from more than one type of legal professional specialising in IP for different rights in your IP portfolio and different types of enforcement actions (such as court action, which may require a lawyer or barrister with litigation experience in IP). 

If you already have a trusted trade mark or patent attorney, you might talk to them about finding the right legal professional for your circumstances. Alternatively, you could search the [Trans-Tasman IP Attorney Board](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm) register as a starting point. 

[![Not sure if this applies to your situation? Start with our Navigator Tool](/sites/default/files/images/2026-02/Not%20sure%20button.png)](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement?utm_content=NotSure_button_experiment_v1)

**How about other types of IP professionals?** 

The term IP professionals refers to a range of experts who can help you plan and manage your business in relation to IP, including legal professionals. If you are seeking advice on how to enforce your IP rights, and what might be most appropriate to your situation, you should seek it from an IP lawyer or other relevant legal professional.  

If you wish to obtain support for other IP-related aspects of your business, you may wish to engage services provided by non-legal IP professionals such as: 

* an accountant who specialises in IP marketing or commercialisation
* a brand consultant
* a franchise and export consultant
* a management consultant
* IP search firms

* Develop an IP strategy for your business.
* Search for existing IP rights similar to your current or future IP.
* Prepare and file your application for a registered right (if they are an IP attorney).
* Develop confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements.
* Provide advice on enforcement options.

### What might the costs be?

The total costs of engaging a legal professional will depend on factors such as their fees and the complexity of the matter. 

For trade mark and patent attorneys, you can expect an average fee of: 

* $400-700 per hour for a [patent attorney](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney).
* $1,000-2,000 total for a [trade mark attorney](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney)  to file and register a single trade mark in one or two classes of goods and services.

Some legal professionals offer a free consultation to assess what services you need and an estimate of costs.  

It's a good idea to ask your legal professional for an indication of how much the entire process may cost for the service you would like to use during your first meeting. 

Some copyright owners could also explore avenues for accessing low- or no-cost legal advice. For example: 

* the Arts Law Centre of Australia (a not-for-profit independent national community legal centre for the arts) can provide advice to artists and arts organisations on queries related to their arts practice, including in relation to copyright ([www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/](http://www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/) ), and also offers templates for some common legal documents, and
* the Australian Copyright Council (an independent, not-for-profit Community Legal Service (CLS) whose affiliate members include the peak bodies for Australian writers, musicians, designers, photographers, visual artists, journalists, film makers and architects) offers eligible persons (predominantly those working in the creative industries) free written advice ([www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/](http://www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/) ).",,"Obtain legal advice on your enforcement options

### How much time might be involved?

Your first consultation is likely to take place shortly after you contact the legal professional. However, the total length of time for engaging their service will vary greatly depending on what steps you decide to take or the services you decide to use. For instance, if you are seeing a legal professional for a court proceeding, you are likely to use their service for the duration of the dispute, while some simple matters may only require one or two meetings.",,"Obtain legal advice on your enforcement options

**Do your homework before you meet**\
Your time is important and an expert's time can be expensive, so it's useful to prepare before you meet with IP lawyers or IP attorneys. Consider:  

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

* [Learning more about IP](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/types-of-ip)  and your specific IP type. Having some basic knowledge will help you to better understand the professional's advice and recommendations.
* Researching what your suspected infringers or competitors are doing in the market (including where they might be based and whether they have registered any IP rights) and being ready to share the results. This will help your IP lawyer or IP attorney to provide you with advice.

**Tips for choosing an IP lawyer or IP attorney**\
Here are some suggestions for choosing an IP lawyer or IP attorney for your IP:  

* Ask for recommendations from other business owners or members of your industry association.
* Ask how much you'll be charged and how long the service will take.
* Don't assume that all lawyers or IP attorneys specialise in the type of IP that you have.
* Try to determine if you can establish a trusting relationship. If you don't feel comfortable sharing relevant information, it could be difficult for an adviser to work in your best interests.

If you think you may need to go to court to enforce your IP rights, speak to an IP lawyer.",,"Obtain legal advice on your enforcement options

### What is it?

Your ideas, brands, inventions and designs can be some of the most valuable assets in your business. Like physical assets, they can grow in value over time -- but only if you take steps to protect them. 

Registering an IP right involves applying through IP Australia for a trade mark, patent, design, or plant breeder's right. Once granted or registered (and certified for design rights), these rights are legally recognised and easier to enforce. They can also become long-term business assets that you can sell, license, or use to attract investment. 

However, 'protection' doesn't always mean registering IP. Copyright, for example, applies automatically to original works like writing, art, music, or software. Confidential information can be protected through contracts, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Trade marks can sometimes be defended under 'common law', though this is usually harder and more expensive than relying on a registered trade mark. 

Contexts where a registered right may be preferred include: 

* When your brand or invention is central to your business identity or growth.
* If you need clear proof of ownership to show to investors, buyers, or lenders.
* When you want confidence to expand into new markets, including overseas.
* Where stopping competitors from copying is critical to your business model.

On the other hand, if your work is short-lived, fast-moving, or unlikely to be copied, automatic protections, contracts or trade secrets may be enough. Many small businesses use a mix of registered and unregistered protections, depending on the stage they are at and what value they see in their ideas. 

Registration is therefore not the only way. However, in the right context, it can provide confidence, recognition, and long-term value that other protections may not.",,"Is it worth registering my IP?

### What is it?

Owning intellectual property (IP) won't earn you money outright without commercialising it, but it can make it easier to grow your business and increase your profit by protecting what makes your business or products valuable. For example: 

* **A patent** gives you the exclusive right to make or use your invention. If people want what you have, and you're the only one legally allowed to sell it, you will have a strong position in the market. Competitors can't copy you which means more business for you.
* **A trade mark** helps protect the name, logo or look of your brand or product. It can stop others from trying to imitate you, and helps customers easily recognise and return to your business. This means people are more likely to choose your product and less likely to buy someone else's by mistake.

There are costs involved when you apply for an IP rights, and also fees to keep it active over time. If someone copies your idea or product without permission, you may need to spend money to stop them. But even with these costs, many businesses choose to invest in IP. That's because it can help protect your unique position in the market which is likely to benefit your business.  

IP can also be valuable when it comes time to sell your business. Owning registered IP shows that your products or brand may be harder for others to copy. That can increase what your business is worth.",,"Does IP help me to make or save money?

### What is it?

If you believe someone is infringing your trade mark in their website's domain name, you might be able to dispute this with the relevant dispute provider. This can result in cancellation or transfer of the domain name.   

The relevant dispute provider will vary depending on the domain name extension: 

* If the domain name extension ends in .au, then the relevant dispute policy is the .au Dispute Resolution Policy (auDRP) provided by auDA.
* If the domain name ends in a generic term like .com, .net or .org, then the relevant policy is the [Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/help/dndr/udrp-en). A full list of approved UDRP providers is available here: [List of Approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers - ICANN](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/providers-6d-2012-02-25-en)   The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a leading provider.
* If the domain name ends in another country code (such as .us, .uk, .nz) then it can be resolved under that country's Dispute Resolution Policy. These are often modelled on the UDRP and many countries (including Australia) allow disputes to be held at WIPO. [Domain Name Dispute Resolution Service for Country Code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs)](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/cctld)

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a leading provider of domain name dispute resolution services. Once you lodge a complaint, a one- or 3-person panel of independent arbitrators and legal practitioners will consider submissions from both parties and provide their decision with reasoning, in writing. There are usually no in-person hearings and the panel's decisions are put into effect by the registrar (the host of the domain name).  

**Please Note:** If the infringing domain name ends in '.au' then the relevant policy is the .au Dispute Resolution Policy (auDRP) provided by auDA.

### What are the benefits?

Benefits vary depending on the relevant dispute resolution policy. Some country code dispute resolution policies may have different requirements.  For the UDRP, and country code policies closely based on it, benefits include: 

* The process can occur even without participation from the other party.
* Fast and accessible process.
* A focus on practical, non-punitive outcomes.
* Fair opportunity for both parties to present their case in writing.
* There is usually no compensation for loss (including lawyers' costs) or damages, meaning this process is less adversarial.
* If using WIPO as a dispute resolution provider, the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center will provide free procedural/service support to help navigate the process.",,"Challenge the use of international domain name

### What are the risks?

* Decisions are usually made public. If you are found to have made an unjustified threat it could expose you to public scrutiny, negative publicity or reputational damage.
* Undergoing a formal dispute resolution process may undermine existing or future business relationships with the other party.
* If either party is unhappy with the decision of the panel, they can initiate legal proceedings. This can get complicated when dealing with international disputes, and will probably be in the registrar's or the registrant's location.

### What are the possible outcomes?

For the UDRP and country code policies based closely on the UDRP, these main outcomes are possible as a result of the panel's decision: 

* The disputed domain name licence(s) cancelled, in which case the domain name(s) will become available for registration by another eligible party.
* The disputed domain name licence(s) is transferred to you.
* The disputed domain name licence(s) remains with the current registrant.
* If the Panel finds that the complaint was brought in bad faith they will note in their decision that the complaint constitutes an abuse of the proceeding called 'reverse domain name hijacking'.
* For more info [WIPO Guide to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/guide/#What_is_a).

You and the other party are still able to reach a direct settlement during the proceedings. If this occurs before a panel is appointed, you are entitled to a partial refund of the filing fee. In most cases this is a refund of US $1,000.",,"Challenge the use of international domain name

### What might the costs be?

**Please note:**Costs vary based on the relevant dispute resolution policy and the provider used. The below is relevant for most dispute resolution providers (DRPs) when disputed at WIPO. 

You must pay a [fee to lodge](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/fees/index.html)  the dispute. Fees start at US$1,500 for single member and US$4,000 for a 3-member panel. 

Fees increase based on how many domain names are in dispute, and whether you choose to have the dispute heard by a panel of one or 3  panellists. If you choose a one-member panel, the domain owner can elect to have the dispute heard by a 3 -member panel (or vice versa), in which case you and the domain owner each pay half of the fee. 

The UDRP when used at WIPO does not award costs or charge additional fees. 

You will also need to pay the fees of any legal representative if you choose to seek their advice or assistance regarding the dispute.",,"Challenge the use of international domain name

### How much time might be involved?

If there are no procedural issues, the case normally should be completed within 2 months from the date WIPO receives the complaint. 

Timelines vary based on the relevant dispute resolution policy and the provider used. The below is relevant for most DRPs when disputed at WIPO.  

WIPO will notify the domain name holder after registrar verification, and an administrative compliance check (up to 5 days). They will then be allowed up to 20 days to provide a response. Otherwise, the decision will be made based on the information you initially provided.   

Once a response has been received or the deadline has passed, panel members will be appointed, and a decision will be made within 14 days. This will be communicated to you, the other party and the registrar of the disputed domain. 

If the panel decides that the disputed domain name should be transferred or cancelled, the domain provider is required to wait 10 business days before fulfilling the decision.

### What is it?

A **Qualified Person (QP)** is a plant-science expert accredited by IP Australia to design, oversee and certify the growing trials used to prove a new variety meets the distinct, uniform and stable (DUS) criteria.  

Every Plant Breeder's Right (PBR) application must name an accredited QP for the plant group in question. You must engage a QP even if you do not need to do an Australian growing trial.Finding the right QP can be essential for running a successful growing trial. Potential plant breeders should consider early if there is a relevant QP from the [Qualified Persons Directory](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/role-of-a-qualified-person/qualified-persons-directory#qpds_e=0)  or consider if the best option for them is to become a QP themselves.  

QP accreditation lasts three years and is tied to specific plant species or groups. QPs may work in consultant or non-consultant status to support breeders and liaise with IP Australia examiners. QPs support breeders and liaise with IP Australia examiners and can be registered to work as consultant QP's for multiple applicants. They can also be non-consultant QP's, overseeing growing trials for their own (or employer's) plant varieties. 

If you have the necessary experience, you can **become** a QP by completing online training, submitting evidence of expertise and paying an accreditation fee. Processing times vary by application volume. Plant breeders have the option of becoming a QP to oversee their own PBR application.  

For breeders, engaging a QP usually involves searching the public  [Qualified Persons Directory](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/role-of-a-qualified-person/qualified-persons-directory#qpds_e=0)  and agreeing to the terms of a contract of work directly with an expert.",,"CHOOSING A ‘QUALIFIED PERSON’ (QP) to conduct growing trials

### What are the benefits?

* Engaging a QP is a requirement to registering a PBR.
* Relevant expert oversight helps set up robust trials and increases chances of a PBR being accepted.
* Accredited status lends credibility when negotiating with investors or partners.
* Choosing the right QP can shorten overall application time by getting the trial right the first time. **Please note:** You must engage a QP even if you do not need to do an Australian growing trial.

### What might the costs be?

Applying to become a QP attracts an accreditation fee (currently $350, renewable every three years). 

For plant breeders, QP professional fees vary according to crop type, location and trial complexity - many experts charge a day rate or project fee. Engaging a QP early in the process can help you understand the additional costs outside of IP Australia fees.

Trade mark infringement can occur when someone uses a brand name, logo, slogan, or another identifying mark that is too similar to someone else's registered trade mark,1 particularly if it is for the same or similar goods or services.2 This can lead to confusion among consumers about the source of the goods or services being offered.

In Australia, there are laws protecting registered trade marks (specifically the *Trade Marks Act 1995* (Cth)).

### What is protected under a registered trade mark?

Understanding what a registered trade mark protects is essential to identifying infringement.4 A trade mark registered with IP Australia gives its owner exclusive rights based on two key components:5

1. **The sign itself** - the word, logo, phrase, or other trade mark registered (see [Kinds of Trade Marks](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/what-are-trade-marks/kinds-of-trade-marks)  for more information).6
2. **The goods and services** - those listed in the registration (see  [Classes of Goods and Services](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/what-are-trade-marks/what-are-classes-of-goods-and-services)  for more information).7

Protection is generally limited to these combined elements.8 For example, a person will infringe a registered trade mark if they use a similar trade mark with the same or similar goods or services listed in the registration. In contrast, there may be no infringement if a similar sign is used for completely different goods or services.9

However, the law does protect well-known trade marks in some cases.10 Infringement can occur when a well-known trade mark is used in relation to goods or services unrelated to the registered trade mark.11",,"Trade mark infringement

### How does trade mark infringement happen?

Where a trade mark is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:

**1. Someone****uses** **a sign ""as a trade mark""**

This is a crucial requirement. The infringer must use the sign as a 'badge of origin,'12 or in other words, to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services.13 This involves using the trade mark to identify or differentiate their products or services in the marketplace.14 This requirement limits infringement and allows for legitimate references to trade marks in contexts that do not suggest commercial origin.

**Examples of use as a trade****mark****:**

* Applying the sign to product packaging or labels15
* Using the sign in advertising to promote goods or services16
* Displaying the sign on business signage or storefronts17
* Using the sign on websites to market products18

**Examples that are not use as a****trade** **mark:**

* Using a word in its ordinary descriptive sense (e.g., using ""apple"" to refer to the fruit)19
* Referring to a trade mark for informational purposes20
* Using a sign purely for functional or decorative purposes21

2. Someone uses an almost identical trade mark or one that is similar enough to confuse people

This is when someone uses a trade mark that resembles or sounds almost exactly like a registered trade mark,22 with only tiny differences that would go unnoticed by most consumers.

**For example,** suppose the word ""KOALA COMFORTS"" is a registered trade mark for bedding products. In that case, using ""KOALA KOMFORTS"" (just changing the spelling) for similar products would likely be considered too similar. Alternatively, someone uses a trade mark that, despite having some differences, is too similar to the registered trade mark. This similarity is likely to confuse consumers about who produces the product or provides the services.23 For instance, it may look or sound similar enough to a registered trade mark. 

**For example,** if ""BLUE WAVE"" with a wave picture is a registered trade mark for surfboards (see below), using ""BLU WAIVES"" with a similar wave design for surf gear could confuse customers into thinking they are from the same company.

![[image: stylised blue wave]](/sites/default/files/images/2025-07/Picture2.png)

When looking at possible trade mark infringement, courts compare the registered trade mark with the alleged infringing trade mark and consider:

* How similar the trade marks look and sound24
* The impression left by the trade marks25
* Whether the trade marks convey the same idea26
* Where and how the products are sold27
* Whether the typical customer would take the time to notice differences28
* Whether anyone has actually been confused.29

**3. Using the mark on the same or similar goods****or** **services**

Lastly, the trade mark is used to sell goods or services that are the same or similar to those listed in the registered trade mark. Therefore, infringement can still occur even when the trade mark is used for goods or services that are not identical to those covered by a registered trade mark but are similar or closely related.30

**For example,** if ""SUNNY DAYS"" is registered for coffee, using ""SUNNY DAYS"" for soft drinks might infringe because both products are related to non-alcoholic beverages.31 Customers might think the same company makes them.

Again, courts consider several factors when determining whether goods or services are similar or closely related.32

Alternatively, infringement can occur when someone uses a 'well known' trade mark in relation to goods or services unrelated to those listed in the registration.33 However, this kind of infringement has not been heard much in court, and its scope is not currently clear.",,"Trade mark infringement

### What is not trade mark infringement

It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The *Trade Marks Act 1995* provides several situations where a trade mark is not infringed, including a person who is:

* using their own name in good faith as a trade mark.34
* just describing the goods or services, or stating where your business is located.35
* indicating the intended purpose of the goods or services (like ""fits iPhone models"").36
* comparing the goods or services to others.37
* using an already registered trade mark.38
* using a trade mark that they could obtain registration for.39
* using a mark that they had before the other mark was registered.40
* re-selling or re-distributing goods that initially used the mark with the owner's permission (including parallel imports41",,"Trade mark infringement

### Understanding the boundaries of protection

It is essential to recognise that trade mark protection has limitations. Let's say, for example, you register ""SMARTBREW"" for coffee machines(listed under class 11) and coffee beans (listed under class 30). Potential infringement situations include:

1. **Clear infringement:** Another business begins selling coffee machines using the name ""SMARTBREW""
   * The alleged infringing mark is being used as a trade mark (it is on the machine and advertising).
   * The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" are identical.
   * The alleged infringing mark is being used for identical products (coffee machines).
2. **Possible infringement:** Another business starts selling coffee filters using ""STARTBREW"".
   * The business is using ""STARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging).
   * The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" look similar and sound similar. Consumers might be confused about where they came from.
   * The mark is being used on related but not identical goods. Courts would consider how similar these goods are.
3. **Unlikely to be infringement:** A company uses ""SMARTBREW"" for completely unrelated goods like gardening tools.
   * The business is using ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging).
   * The marks are identical, but the company uses the trade mark on goods that differ from the registered trade mark.
4. **Not infringement:** A coffee critique writes a review of the product entitled ""Is SmartBrew worth the money?""
   * The article's author is not using the word ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark.
5. **Not infringement:** Another company uses a different coffee-related name, like ""CLEVER COFFEE"", for coffee machines.
   * The business is using ""CLEVER COFFEE"" as a trade mark.
   * However, ""CLEVER COFFEE"" and the registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" are too dissimilar.

Navigating trade mark infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Additionally, the registered trade mark must be legally valid. A registered trade mark may be challenged in court and sought to be cancelled during a claim of infringement. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

### What is it?

When you think someone has copied your product, logo, idea or brand, it is called 'suspected infringement'. The word 'suspected' is used because only a court can decide if infringement has actually occurred - but that doesn't mean you cannot take action. 

Different types of IP are protected in different ways. You can only take action if your IP is protected by a specific right such as a registered trade mark, granted patent, certified design, or copyright. 

If you don't have formal IP rights, it may still be possible to take action, but it can be harder. Some legal protections may still apply under consumer law, contract law or common law--but these usually require help from a legal professional. 

Start by working out: 

* What exactly has been copied--your logo, invention, product, written work, name, style or something else.
* Whether what's been copied is actually protected by a registered or automatic IP right.
* Whether the use is actually unauthorised or illegal - some uses may be allowed, or may not amount to infringement under the law.

It's not always obvious whether infringement has happened. Even when someone copies your work, it may not be illegal. For example, your product might be copied legally if it isn't covered by a registered design or patent. 

To figure out what's going on, many people start by: 

* Checking their own IP rights (such as trade mark, patent, design or copyright status).
* Gathering evidence--like photos, screenshots, or product listings showing the suspected use.
* Looking at how similar the two things are, and whether there's confusion or copying.

You may wish to speak with a legal professional to assess whether the other person's behaviour may legally amount to infringement. Qualified experts for IP enforcement include lawyers who specialise in IP, as well as registered trade mark and patent attorneys.",,"What do I do if someone copies my stuff?

### What is it?

Many people assume there is one IP office that grants rights everywhere in the world. In reality, each country has its own intellectual property (IP) office. For instance, IP Australia examines and registers patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeder's rights (PBRs) for protection inside Australia.  

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) helps countries work together on IP and provides systems to simplify applying for rights overseas. However, it is not a global IP office that grants or enforces rights.  

WIPO's core role is to administer international treaties, maintain global IP databases and provide systems that streamline applications across borders. It helps countries adopt consistent rules and offers tools businesses can use when expanding overseas. Key examples include: 

* **The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).** This allows you to file one application to seek patent protection in 158 Contracting States.
* **The Madrid System.** This provides a single-application path for registering trade marks in over 130 territories.
* **The Hague System.** This is an international route for protecting industrial designs in multiple countries.
* **The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center**. These services may resolve cross-border IP disputes without going to court.

Because WIPO focuses on coordination and policy development, national IP offices keep control of day-to-day tasks such as filing applications, examining rights, registration and renewal. 

When your business grows beyond Australia, you may use WIPO's 'single-application' process to streamline filing. However, the national IP office in each country still decides whether to grant protection in its jurisdiction under its own laws. 

In short, WIPO is a hub for international treaty development and shared services, while national offices like IP Australia remain the home base for securing IP rights within their territories.",,"Is there a global IP office?

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

One way to target infringing products is contacting the businesses that make, ship, or sell the suspected infringing goods and asking them to take action. These 'intermediaries' might include manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, suppliers or importers. 

Several intermediaries operate along a product's supply chain and can be used to help prevent infringement. If third party businesses are inadvertently involved in facilitating IP infringement, they may be willing to cease this activity once they are made aware. This could include stopping things like manufacturing the goods, stocking or advertising them, handling payments, repairing items, or delivering orders. 

You might wish to consider sending a polite letter, call, or visit in person to explain your rights, provide evidence, and ask the intermediary to stop production or sales. Clear, factual information can persuade them to cooperate. 

This approach is informal and voluntary, but can be effective as businesses generally prefer to avoid risks. In some cases, intermediaries may be liable for facilitating IP infringing activity, though a legal professional will be able to advise you on whether this relates to your situation.

### What is it?

A 'freedom to operate' search helps you check whether your product or process might infringe on someone else's patent. It's sometimes called a 'clearance search'. 

This kind of search can help identify if there are any existing patent rights that could block you from making, using, or selling your product or invention - particularly in the countries where you plan to operate. 

If products or inventions are found that might be relevant, you may wish to explore options such as changing your design, negotiating a licence, or asking a legal professional to investigate further. 

You can do a basic search yourself using free tools like the Australian patent search Australian Patent Search, or global databases like [Espacenet - patent search](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/). However, a freedom to operate search is more detailed than just checking if something is new - it often requires specialist help to interpret results properly. 

A freedom to operate search typically only searches patents, and does not include other sources such as published research papers or other businesses selling similar products: the search only focuses on patents on which your idea or product would potentially infringe.

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

If other efforts to resolve a dispute are unsuccessful or not appropriate for your situation, you may consider starting a legal claim in court. Going to court is usually a last resort. Court proceedings are expensive, time consuming and stressful and obtaining the outcome you seek is never guaranteed. 

**It is prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal action in court.** You will likely also need assistance from an IP lawyer if you decide to start a legal action. 

Patent proceedings usually involve:  

* a validity challenge intended to revoke a patent in whole or in part
* allegations of infringement of a patent.

Patent proceedings in Australia are typically started in the Federal Court of Australia.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

D1018,Court - Patent,D1018_03,238,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions
Court - Patent

### What are the benefits?

* If you succeed, a court may award damages or compensation to cover various losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made by the infringer through their infringement).
* Court decisions are binding and enforceable.
* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.
* You can resolve several related matters in one case including claims of infringement, patent validity challenges and other related legal claims.
* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.
* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.
* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage parties to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid court proceedings continuing.
* For infringement claims, a court can in appropriate situations make orders to prevent the infringer from continuing to infringe your IP rights.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the risks?

* The outcome can be unpredictable.
* While a court can determine matters of law, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.
* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you.
* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties if you are wholly (or partially) unsuccessful.
* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you.
* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful and time-consuming and distract from the operation of your business.
* Court proceedings are usually public, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.
* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.
* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.
* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).
* You may not be able to bring a legal claim if you have agreed in a contract that you will use, or that you will first try, an alternative form of dispute resolution.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the possible outcomes?

The possible outcomes vary depending on the type of litigation.   

It is possible you may reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.  

For revocation proceedings, a court might order that a patent be:  

* revoked in whole or in part
* amended in whole or in part
* upheld in whole or in part.

It is also possible to have a mixed result. For example, if some of the claims in a patent are challenged, one claim might be upheld and the other claim might be revoked. 

For infringement proceedings:  

* A court might temporarily order the alleged infringer to stop any alleged infringement until a final decision is made - see [Seek an urgent injunction](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/Interim_Injunction)
* If you're successful in infringement proceedings, a court might order:
  + that you be paid damages or compensation
  + that the other party or parties pay some or all of your legal costs
  + the infringer not to infringe your IP rights in future.
* If you're unsuccessful in infringement proceedings, a court might order:
  + that you pay some or all of the legal costs for the other party or parties.

Again, it is possible to have a mixed result. For example, a court might agree that some of the other party's conduct infringes your patent, but that other conduct does not. 

Courts also have powers to make other types of orders as part of the outcome. 

You or the other party or parties may be able to appeal the decision.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What might the costs be?

While simple patent-related litigation may cost [between $100-500k](https://www.twobirds.com/-/media/new-website-content/microsites/patent-hub/country-comparison-tool/australia---q,-a-,a.pdf), major patent litigation can cost in the millions. Appeals cost anywhere from $150k-300k+. 

Legal representation typically makes up a large proportion of these costs.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

D1018,Court - Patent,D1018_07,296,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions
Court - Patent

### How much time might be involved?

Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, and which court hears your claim.  

Patent cases are typically heard by the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed *intellectual property* as the cause of action, were as follows:~~;~~ 

* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months
* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months
* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1

If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.   

Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.   

**Time limits for starting legal claims**

There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start. Due to the complexities, it may be helpful to  speak to an IP lawyer about time limits.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### How much is this used?

Patent proceedings are not particularly common in Australia because they can be expensive and time consuming for the parties involved. 

In the 2023-24 financial year, there were 41 patent and associated statutes filings in the Federal Court of Australia.2

### What do you need to proceed?

Here are some things you might consider before you proceed with legal action in a patent  matter. 

**Find an IP lawyer for advice and representation**\
Court proceedings can be an expensive, time-consuming, stressful, complicated process that can have a serious impact on you and your business. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.  

**Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim**\
Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes. 

**Consider the impact of publicity**\
Court proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.

**Gather all your documents**\
Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### How to avoid infringing others' intellectual property

Running a business or developing new products or services often means creating intellectual property (IP) or encountering IP rights owned by others. Whether it is a brand name, invention, design, or creative work, using something similar to someone else's existing intellectual property may be considered infringement.

An IP owner may contact you informally, seeking an amicable resolution, or formally, with a letter from a lawyer demanding that the infringement stop. Alternatively, IP owners might initiate legal action, requesting a court to stop you from using a brand, design, or technology, or to compel you to pay damages to the IP owner. In some instances, you may be required to destroy products or marketing materials.

It is crucial to understand that you can infringe on someone's IP rights without even knowing those rights exist. While you might not have to pay monetary compensation (called damages) to the IP owner if you genuinely had no reason to believe the IP existed, you can still be ordered to stop using the IP.

Understanding how to avoid infringing on others' rights from the beginning can save your business from serious consequences. With awareness and careful planning, you can minimise the risk of infringing on others' intellectual property rights.",,"How to avoid infringing others' intellectual property

Whether it is a brand name, invention, design, or creative work, using something similar to someone else's existing intellectual property may be considered infringement.
### Avoiding IP infringement

**1. Conduct searches before you invest**

One of the most effective ways to avoid IP infringement is to check for existing rights before committing to a new venture. For example, before launching a new product, brand, or service, you should search the Australian trade mark register using IP Australia's [Australian Trade Mark Search](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/quick), check design registers for similar registered designs through the [Australian Design Search](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/designs/search/quick), check plant varieties on [the Australian PBR Search,](https://ipsearch.ipaustralia.gov.au/pbr/)  and search patents on [the Australian Patent Search](https://ipsearch.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents/)  if you are developing new technology. 

However, not all intellectual property is registered with IP Australia. For instance, individuals are not required to register their copyright in original creative works. In this case, start by cataloguing all the content you plan to use. Such material can include text, images, videos, music, and graphics. Knowing precisely what you have will simplify your search. After that, conduct a quick online search for key phrases or images in your work. Using reverse image search tools (such as Google Images or TinEye) can help identify copied visuals. For text, paste sections into a search engine or utilise plagiarism checkers (such as Turnitin or Grammarly).

By searching first, you can avoid unintentionally infringing on others' intellectual property rights.

**For example,** a Melbourne café owner wanted to name their business ""The Daily Grind"". A quick trade mark search revealed several similar registered marks in the food services class, prompting them to choose a different name before investing in signage and marketing.

**2. Create original work**

The safest way to avoid infringement is to create original content. This approach applies to brand names and logos, product designs, marketing materials, website content, and product packaging. By creating something original, you not only avoid infringing on others' rights but also build valuable IP assets.

**For example,**instead of copying a competitor's product packaging, a small cosmetics company hired a graphic designer to develop distinct packaging that reflected their brand values while avoiding existing designs.

**3. Understand what you can and cannot use**

Not all uses of others' IP require permission. Australian law permits specific uses without the IP owner's consent. For instance, under copyright law, 'fair dealing' exceptions allow limited use of copyright material for particular purposes, such as research, criticism, or parody.

You can also use IP where the rights have expired. However, be cautious, as some rights may still be eligible for renewal. 

**4. Get permission when needed**

Obtaining proper permission is essential if you want to use someone else's IP. This means securing a written agreement (often called a licence) that outlines what you can and cannot do with the IP. A verbal agreement or an email may seem sufficient at the time, but written documentation safeguards both parties and prevents future misunderstandings.

It is a good idea to maintain thorough records of all permissions granted, understand any limitations on the use of the IP, and consider obtaining professional legal advice for complex arrangements.

**5. Be cautious with online content**

The internet can create a false sense that content is freely available for use. However, just because something appears online does not mean it is free to use, and do not assume that attribution alone makes copying acceptable. Images, text, and videos are typically protected by copyright from the moment they are created. Company names and logos are often registered trade marks, and product designs may be protected by registered design rights. Always search IP databases and seek licences before using online content.",,"How to avoid infringing others' intellectual property

### Red flags to watch for

Specific situations should prompt extra caution in your IP practices. For instance, exercise particular care if you find yourself:

* closely copying a competitor's successful product or brand,
* using material that you have found online,
* modifying someone else's work slightly and claiming it as your own, or
* importing products without checking Australian IP rights.

These scenarios frequently lead to infringement disputes and should prompt you to seek advice before proceeding.",,"How to avoid infringing others' intellectual property

### When to seek help

Professional advice is especially valuable in specific situations. Seeking early professional guidance often costs much less than defending against an infringement claim later. Consider speaking with an IP professional when:

* Search results reveal similar existing rights to those you plan to use.
* You are developing products for highly competitive markets.
* You receive a letter of demand or a 'cease and desist' letter.",,"How to avoid infringing others' intellectual property

### What is it?

A patent re-examination is a means for challenging the *validity*\* of a granted patent. In certain situations, such as being accused of infringement, the validity of the patent may come under heavy scrutiny. This can be requested at any time after a patent is granted by filing a request with IP Australia. Patent re-examination can be requested if you believe the patent should not have been granted for a variety of reasons, including; 

* The invention claimed in the patent isn't novel, innovative or inventive (this is the most common reason)
* The invention isn't something that can be patented
* The invention was used in public before the patent was filed
* The patent specification doesn't provide enough detail to build or perform the invention
* The invention isn't consistent with the description
* The claims are so unclear that it's impossible for a skilled person to understand them
* The invention is a biological process for generation of human beings (such as human cloning).

*\*the validity of a patent regards its compliance with the Patents Act, i.e. if it should have been granted in the first place (or has new evidence come to light that indicates it should not have been granted).*

### What are the benefits?

A patent re-examination provides a relatively affordable and expedient means of challenging the validity of a patent. 

The re-examination process also allows for the submission of documents and supporting evidence from the challenging party, including citations which may not have been considered when the patent was examined. 

One additional benefit of the re-examination process, is that it operates independently of the court system, meaning that it will not prejudice any subsequent litigation (i.e. it won't influence a judge in a court case). Note that re-examination decisions may be appealed to the Federal Court.",,"Challenge a granted patent

### What are the risks?

There are some risks associated with the patent re-examination process.  

While the costs associated with a re-examination request are low, there is still the possibility that the challenging party will not be successful, and the patent will be maintained. Notably, the re-examination process also allows the patent holder to amend their claims; in some cases, allowing them to circumvent the grounds on which the patent was challenged.  

Another significant risk associated with re-examination, is that the process is '*ex parte'*, meaning that after the initial submissions to the Patent Office, the challenging party is not involved in the proceedings at all. As such, if the outcome of the re-examination is not in favour of the challenging party, they have few options to refute the outcome (although, another re-examination can be *requested*). 

Requesting a re-examination will also inform the other party of your request, potentially harming professional relationships and increasing the possibility that the other party may act more defensively or even contest your own rights.",,"Challenge a granted patent

### What are the possible outcomes?

There are 4 possible outcomes from the patent re-examination process: 

* The patent is upheld in its original form
* The patent is upheld in an amended form
* The patent is revoked
* In rare cases, IP Australia may not consider the re-examination request reasonable and refuse to re-examine the case.

If the challenging party remains unsatisfied, they are able escalate to invalidity proceedings in court (at significantly higher cost).",,"Challenge a granted patent

A re-examination report will be provided within 8 weeks from receiving the first response. In cases where the initial re-examination report is adverse (i.e. that the patent should not have been granted), the patentee may amend the claims, and subsequent reports may be issued, this may take significantly longer (typically 4-6 months).",,"Challenge a granted patent

### What is it?

Intellectual property (IP) is a term used to describe 'creations of the mind' that the law can help protect. This includes things like inventions, brand names, logos, designs, creative works, and plant varieties. Owning an IP right means you may have the exclusive legal right to use, make, sell, or licence the creation. 

IP rights can help you stop others from using your work without permission. They can also make your business more valuable by protecting what makes it unique. For example, a registered trade mark can help stop competitors from using a brand name or logo that is too similar to yours. Many businesses use IP to secure investment, create partnerships, or licence their creations to others. This can open up new revenue streams and help build customer trust in your brand. 

The main types of IP rights in Australia are: 

* **Patents** - Protect inventions and new ways of doing things.
* **Trade marks** - Protect brand identifiers like names, logos, and slogans.
* **Designs** - Protect the visual appearance of a product.
* **Plant breeder's rights (PBRs)** - Protect new plant varieties.
* **Copyright** - Protects original works such as books, music, software, and art.

Some IP rights need to be registered through IP Australia, like patents, designs, and PBRs. While trade marks can be used without registration, some enforcement options are only available for registered trade marks.  

Copyright is automatic when you create certain types of works, but registration is available for some kinds of copyright in other countries. 

Holding an IP right can make it easier to take action against suspected infringement, including using legal processes to stop the use, sale, or import of copies. This may involve going to a court that can decide whether infringement has occurred, but registered rights may strengthen your position if you need to enforce them.",,"What is IP and how does it protect me?

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

If other efforts to resolve a dispute are unsuccessful or not appropriate for your situation, you may consider starting a legal claim in court. Going to court is usually a last resort. Court proceedings are expensive, time consuming and stressful and obtaining the outcome you seek is never guaranteed. 

**It is prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal action in court.** You will likely also need assistance from an IP lawyer if you decide to start a legal action. 

Patent proceedings usually involve:  

* a validity challenge intended to revoke a patent in whole or in part
* allegations of infringement of a patent.

Patent proceedings in Australia are typically started in the Federal Court of Australia.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

D1018,Court - Patent,D1018_03,238,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the benefits?

* If you succeed, a court may award damages or compensation to cover various losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made by the infringer through their infringement).
* Court decisions are binding and enforceable.
* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.
* You can resolve several related matters in one case including claims of infringement, patent validity challenges and other related legal claims.
* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.
* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.
* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage parties to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid court proceedings continuing.
* For infringement claims, a court can in appropriate situations make orders to prevent the infringer from continuing to infringe your IP rights.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the risks?

* The outcome can be unpredictable.
* While a court can determine matters of law, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.
* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you.
* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties if you are wholly (or partially) unsuccessful.
* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you.
* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful and time-consuming and distract from the operation of your business.
* Court proceedings are usually public, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.
* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.
* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.
* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).
* You may not be able to bring a legal claim if you have agreed in a contract that you will use, or that you will first try, an alternative form of dispute resolution.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the possible outcomes?

The possible outcomes vary depending on the type of litigation.   

It is possible you may reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.  

For revocation proceedings, a court might order that a patent be:  

* revoked in whole or in part
* amended in whole or in part
* upheld in whole or in part.

It is also possible to have a mixed result. For example, if some of the claims in a patent are challenged, one claim might be upheld and the other claim might be revoked. 

For infringement proceedings:  

* A court might temporarily order the alleged infringer to stop any alleged infringement until a final decision is made - see [Seek an urgent injunction](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/Interim_Injunction)
* If you're successful in infringement proceedings, a court might order:
  + that you be paid damages or compensation
  + that the other party or parties pay some or all of your legal costs
  + the infringer not to infringe your IP rights in future.
* If you're unsuccessful in infringement proceedings, a court might order:
  + that you pay some or all of the legal costs for the other party or parties.

Again, it is possible to have a mixed result. For example, a court might agree that some of the other party's conduct infringes your patent, but that other conduct does not. 

Courts also have powers to make other types of orders as part of the outcome. 

You or the other party or parties may be able to appeal the decision.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What might the costs be?

While simple patent-related litigation may cost [between $100-500k](https://www.twobirds.com/-/media/new-website-content/microsites/patent-hub/country-comparison-tool/australia---q,-a-,a.pdf), major patent litigation can cost in the millions. Appeals cost anywhere from $150k-300k+. 

Legal representation typically makes up a large proportion of these costs.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### How much time might be involved?

Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, and which court hears your claim.  

Patent cases are typically heard by the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed *intellectual property* as the cause of action, were as follows:~~;~~ 

* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months
* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months
* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1

If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.   

Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.   

**Time limits for starting legal claims**

There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start. Due to the complexities, it may be helpful to  speak to an IP lawyer about time limits.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

Patent proceedings are not particularly common in Australia because they can be expensive and time consuming for the parties involved.

### What do you need to proceed?

Here are some things you might consider before you proceed with legal action in a patent  matter. 

**Find an IP lawyer for advice and representation**\
Court proceedings can be an expensive, time-consuming, stressful, complicated process that can have a serious impact on you and your business. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.  

**Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim**\
Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes. 

**Consider the impact of publicity**\
Court proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.

**Gather all your documents**\
Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What is it?

After the publication of acceptance in the Australian Journal of Patents, there is a 3-month window before the patent is 'granted'. In this intervening period, anyone can challenge the decision to grant the patent by making a formal objection, known as an *opposition*, to IP Australia. 

There are a variety of reasons for an opposition, however the most common are when someone else believes that your invention is identical or very similar to another patent (and therefore isn't new and inventive), or that the patentee isn't the true owner of the invention. 

Hearings can be heard either by written submissions, or as an oral hearing. Although the hearings are relatively informal (compared to court proceedings), and oral and written hearings vary slightly, in both cases you and the other party will both have an opportunity to argue your cases by reference to the law and evidence. You may also elect to be represented by a patent attorney or other legal professional. 

Notably, hearings are the final step in the opposition process, and they do not always occur. Parties can negotiate and come to a settlement prior to the hearing (thus ending the opposition).",,"Challenge a new or amended patent

### What are the benefits?

Patent oppositions provide a moderately cost-effective mechanism to challenge the validity of an Australian patent application. Additionally, the oppositions process is adversarial, meaning that you will have the opportunity to provide evidence and refute or reply to evidence provided by the opposition regarding the legal and/or factual arguments directed against the patent.  

Additionally, the oppositions process takes place prior to the grant of the patent, potentially reducing the risk of commercial disputes arising from the grant of the patent.",,"Challenge a new or amended patent

* When opposing the acceptance of a patent, the applicant will be informed of your opposition, as well as any documents or evidence provided (unless you notify IP Australia of the confidentiality requirement for some or all of the documents). You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the applicant be aware of you and access these materials.
* It is possible that filing an opposition may alert the other party to your claims and can cause them to act more defensively or even contest your own rights.
* Using this process improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.
* If you are late in providing evidence which you promised, late fees may be owed to IP Australia.",,"Challenge a new or amended patent

### What is it?

Licensing is a legal arrangement where you, as the rights holder, give another party permission to use your IP rights under agreed terms. This can be done for any IP rights you own or have the right to sublicense, and may apply across specific products, industries or geographic areas.  

Deciding to grant someone else the right to use your IP rights could benefit your business and may be an effective way to resolve various IP disputes, including where another party wants to keep using your IP rights. You can investigate potential licensees yourself or engage an IP professional to assist. 

Types of licences can include: 

* Exclusive licences (you grant IP rights to only one licensee and can no longer use the IP yourself),
* Non-exclusive licences (you grant IP rights to multiple parties and retain the right to use the IP yourself), or
* Sole licences (you grant IP rights to only one licensee and retain the right to use the IP yourself).",,"Explore opportunities by licensing  your IP

### What are the benefits?

Licensing your IP can offer several advantages: 

* Generating income from ongoing royalty payments or a single lump-sum payment.
* Expanding into new markets without setting-up operations yourself.
* Retaining ownership while allowing others to use your IP.
* Depending on the licence you choose, you can allow others to use your IP but retain the right to use the IP yourself.
* Strengthening business relationships and opening up partnership opportunities.
* Leveraging another party's distribution, manufacturing or marketing capacity.
* Maintaining control through terms and restrictions in the agreement.
* Licences are incredibly flexible - you can choose what, where, when and how IP can be used.",,"Explore opportunities by licensing  your IP

### What are the risks?

Licensing your IP also comes with potential risks: 

* Disputes can arise if the terms of the licence are not clear. Getting an IP professional to draft the licence can help to reduce this risk.
* You may need to monitor the licence agreement to ensure the other party complies with it.
* Licensing your IP rights to others has the potential to reduce the uniqueness or value of your IP depending on the circumstances, including who you license it to and the licensing terms.
* If you *exclusively* license your IP rights, you will no longer be able to use them yourself.
* In specific instances regarding trade marks, if the licensor is unable to maintain effective controls over trade mark use, the trade mark can become vulnerable to removal for non-use.
* In the case a patent has been licensed to an exclusive licensee - they will have the right to commence infringement proceedings. In some cases, the patent holder can also be added as a party to those proceedings, potentially leading to legal action or expense.
* If you do not put in place arrangements to protect your sensitive commercial information (such as specific business practices or product features) during negotiations, it may be shared with other parties or misused by the recipient.
* You may also need to consider the potential tax implications of the licence, particularly if you are operating in multiple jurisdictions.",,"Explore opportunities by licensing  your IP

### What is it?

If you're dealing with a suspected infringement or need help securing or enforcing your IP rights, you may want to speak with a qualified legal professional. 

Legal professionals can help you understand your rights, the strength of your case, and the legal processes involved. This may include general lawyers, IP lawyers, or specialist attorneys (such as patent or trade mark attorneys). 

Hiring a legal professional does not guarantee that you will win a dispute, but it may give you confidence that your rights are being taken seriously and your next steps are well considered. 

Here's what you can generally expect: 

* They can help you understand if what's happening may be a suspected infringement and what options are available.
* They may draft or review documents such as letters of demand, agreements, or court submissions.
* Some are also qualified to represent you in court or at hearings.
* Attorneys (such as patent and trade mark attorneys) are specially trained in certain IP rights and may help with applications, oppositions, or enforcement; though not all attorneys are lawyers.

You should ask early about the costs, timing, and what's included in their services. Some professionals charge a fixed fee, while others bill hourly. 

**Please note:** Trade mark and patent attorneys are not technically lawyers, but they are qualified to give advice on specific IP rights under Australian law.",,"What can I expect from a lawyer or attorney?

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

Rebranding your business can be an effective strategy to make sure you're not infringing existing trade marks, to avoid disputes with other parties, or to apply for a new trade mark after your application to register a trade mark hasn't been successful.  

While contemplating rebranding your business can feel very personal - and it is important to acknowledge any emotional response you have to the situation - choosing to take this action (as part of a thought-out IP strategy) can be a valid and rational choice.  

Many successful businesses have rebranded throughout their history as strategic moves. Rather than being an act of admitting defeat or suggesting that one party was 'right', rebranding can be a savvy forward-looking choice that can help you avoid costly IP disputes and focus on your core business.  

Regardless of whether you have a strong claim to the use of a trade marked brand or are accused of infringing, some reasons for choosing to rebrand to avoid any potential conflict might include: 

* There may be commercial relationships you wish to preserve
* The other party is more willing and able to argue the conflict than yourself
* You cannot be sure of the merits or ownership status of your right (for example, the matter is not black and white, or it would be costly to determine the relative merits of your position)
* The new brand would be a relatively simple change for you, with little loss of business advantage
* The cost or effort of other actions (enforcing or defending your right) far outweighs the value of the right and cost of rebranding.

### What are the benefits?

* Rebranding does not require the cooperation or even engagement with the other party, and is thus a very non-adversarial process.
* You have the control to avoid conflict - unlike adversarial processes which have unpredictable outcomes.
* It might be a more productive way to use your resources, compared to professional fees which may not add sufficient value to your business.
* You will be able to better distinguish yourself in the marketplace and lower the risk of confusion in the marketplace.
* The time, cost and labour required to take actions to avoid infringement on your IP may not be justified at this point in your business or IP journey.
* Choosing to avoid enforcement actions shelters you from needing to establish or defend your rights, which you may not wish to draw attention to.
* Additionally, clearly distinguishing yourself from competitors will help your customers avoid confusion, which may occur even if both parties have a registered right to use the trade mark.",,"Choose to rebrand to avoid potential IP conflicts

### What are the risks?

* Without professional advice, there is a risk that you will miss easy and effective enforcement options.
* You may have a legal right to use the IP and will have given it up when you didn't have to; advice from an IP professional can help you determine this.
* Rebranding may not resolve the fundamental IP issue (e.g. you may believe that the new brand is different enough, but someone else could still consider it *deceptively similar*,and thus grounds for challenging).
* You may lose some reputation/goodwill you may have built under your previous brand.
* Rebranding will not resolve any disputes about the design or the functional elements of your product(s).
* While rebranding does not necessarily require engagement with the other party, without engagement or agreement, you can't be assured the other party will not pursue enforcement actions (which may have occurred while using the previous brand).",,"Choose to rebrand to avoid potential IP conflicts

### What is it?

A patent re-examination is a means for challenging the *validity*\* of a granted patent. In certain situations, such as being accused of infringement, the validity of the patent may come under heavy scrutiny. This can be requested at any time after a patent is granted by filing a request with IP Australia. Patent re-examination can be requested if you believe the patent should not have been granted for a variety of reasons, including; 

* The invention claimed in the patent isn't novel, innovative or inventive (this is the most common reason)
* The invention isn't something that can be patented
* The invention was used in public before the patent was filed
* The patent specification doesn't provide enough detail to build or perform the invention
* The invention isn't consistent with the description
* The claims are so unclear that it's impossible for a skilled person to understand them
* The invention is a biological process for generation of human beings (such as human cloning).

*\*the validity of a patent regards its compliance with the Patents Act, i.e. if it should have been granted in the first place (or has new evidence come to light that indicates it should not have been granted).*

Patent Re-Examination

### What are the benefits?

A patent re-examination provides a relatively affordable and expedient means of challenging the validity of a patent. 

The re-examination process also allows for the submission of documents and supporting evidence from the challenging party, including citations which may not have been considered when the patent was examined. 

One additional benefit of the re-examination process, is that it operates independently of the court system, meaning that it will not prejudice any subsequent litigation (i.e. it won't influence a judge in a court case). Note that re-examination decisions may be appealed to the Federal Court.",,"Challenge a granted patent

B1009,Patent Re-Examination ,B1009_04,243,"Challenge a granted patent 
Patent Re-Examination

### What are the risks?

There are some risks associated with the patent re-examination process.  

While the costs associated with a re-examination request are low, there is still the possibility that the challenging party will not be successful, and the patent will be maintained. Notably, the re-examination process also allows the patent holder to amend their claims; in some cases, allowing them to circumvent the grounds on which the patent was challenged.  

Another significant risk associated with re-examination, is that the process is '*ex parte'*, meaning that after the initial submissions to the Patent Office, the challenging party is not involved in the proceedings at all. As such, if the outcome of the re-examination is not in favour of the challenging party, they have few options to refute the outcome (although, another re-examination can be *requested*). 

Requesting a re-examination will also inform the other party of your request, potentially harming professional relationships and increasing the possibility that the other party may act more defensively or even contest your own rights.",,"Challenge a granted patent

### What are the possible outcomes?

There are 4 possible outcomes from the patent re-examination process: 

* The patent is upheld in its original form
* The patent is upheld in an amended form
* The patent is revoked
* In rare cases, IP Australia may not consider the re-examination request reasonable and refuse to re-examine the case.

If the challenging party remains unsatisfied, they are able escalate to invalidity proceedings in court (at significantly higher cost).",,"Challenge a granted patent

A re-examination report will be provided within 8 weeks from receiving the first response.

### What is it?

If other efforts to resolve a dispute are unsuccessful or not appropriate, you may consider starting a legal claim in court. Court proceedings are usually a last resort. They can be expensive, time consuming and stressful, and the outcome is not guaranteed to be in your favour.

**It is prudent to seek legal advice before starting legal proceedings. You will likely also need the assistance of a lawyer with experience in IP.**

Court proceedings for plant breeder's rights (PBRs) may involve:

* allegations of suspected infringement of a PBR

* challenges to the validity of a granted PBR (sometimes raised as a counterclaim in infringement proceedings).

In Australia, PBR disputes are heard in the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2). A court can determine if a PBR has been infringed, whether the PBR is valid, and make binding orders to resolve the dispute.

PBR court cases can involve a search order (*Anton Piller order).* This is a court order that provides the right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. This is primarily intended to prevent destruction of relevant evidence.

These are only granted in narrow circumstances, including that you have a strong case, and there's sufficient evidence that important material might be destroyed. For more detailed information about an Anton Piller order, consider seeking professional advice.

**PBR court cases are rare. This means there is limited legal precedent for judges and lawyers to draw on. This makes it harder to build a strong case, increases potential costs, and adds uncertainty to how a judge might rule.**

### What are the possible outcomes?

Possible outcomes will depend on the circumstances and the type of claim. They may include:

* A negotiated settlement between the parties.
* Revocation of the PBR in whole or in part (by a counterclaim in court, or by the Registrar on application by a person whose interests are affected).
* Injunctions ordering the alleged infringer to stop infringing the PBR, including temporary (interlocutory) injunctions.
* Damages or compensation awarded to the PBR owner, or an account of profits (but not both).
* Additional damages awarded in appropriate cases.
* Orders on payment of legal costs by one or both parties.
* Mixed results, where some claims succeed but others fail.

It is possible to have a mixed result. For example, a court might agree that some of the other party's conduct infringes your PBR, but that other conduct does not.

Courts also have powers to make other types of orders as part of the outcome.

### What might the costs be?

Court proceedings are among the most expensive options for resolving PBR disputes. Legal representation usually makes up the largest cost. For comparison, simple patent-related litigation, which are similar to PBR cases in terms of complexity, may cost [between $100-500k .](https://www.twobirds.com/-/media/new-website-content/microsites/patent-hub/country-comparison-tool/australia---q,-a-,a.pdf)  Major patent litigation can cost in the millions. Appeals cost anywhere from $150k-300k+. 

**Because of the lack of legal precedent for PBR, it is likely that any PBR dispute in court will be expensive.** 

If you lose, you may also be required to pay the other party's legal costs.

### What do you need to proceed?

There are some things you might consider before you proceed with legal action in a PBR matter.

* **Find an IP lawyer for advice and representation**\
  Court proceedings can be an expensive, time-consuming, stressful, complicated process that can have a serious impact on you and your business. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.
* **Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim**\
  Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.
* **Consider the impact of publicity**\
  Court proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.
* **Gather all your documents**\
  Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that helps to show what was sold, grown or distributed. It can be beneficial to organise these materials so that they show dates, sources, and how the suspected copying connects back to your variety, as courts often rely on orderly, traceable evidence. You can give these to your lawyer to review.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### Legal professionals

If you are seeking advice on how to enforce or defend your IP rights, and what actions might be most appropriate for your situation, speak to a lawyer or other relevant legal professional. We use the term 'legal professional' to refer to professionals who aren't necessarily lawyers, such as IP attorneys. IP attorneys (registered patent or trade mark attorneys) are not necessarily lawyers, but they are qualified to provide information about protecting IP.

Many IP lawyers and IP attorneys have specialties relating to particular industries or situations, and may be more effective in their particular field of expertise. For instance, some IP lawyers may specialise and be highly experienced in dealing with trade marks, but less experienced with patents.

Both an IP lawyer or IP attorney can provide you with advice and act for you at different stages of IP protection and enforcement. Read below to consider which is most appropriate for your needs.",,"Choosing the right IP professional

### Trade mark attorneys

**Who they are:** Specialists in trade marks who focus on obtaining and maintaining registered IP rights to protect brands (names, logos, slogans) and support business growth.

**Professional standards:** Attorneys must be registered with the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board. They are required to complete ongoing education, and are bound by strict professional and ethical standards.

**How they can help (for example):**

* Advise whether a brand is registrable and run clearance searches to identify conflicts.
* Prepare and lodge trade mark applications in Australia and some other countries; manage renewals and ownership changes.
* Help respond to objections and file oppositions with IP Australia in relation to trade mark applications.
* Advise on brand strategy and related IP options where appropriate.
* Monitor competitors and support steps to enforce rights.
* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.
* Assist with licensing.
* Advise on possible infringement risks relating to others' rights.

**What they don't do:**  A trade mark attorney cannot provide general legal advice and can't conduct proceedings in a court. If you engage an IP attorney, they would need to refer you to a lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.

### Patent attorneys

**Who they are:** Specialists in patent law and practice with in-depth knowledge of one or more fields of science or technology, used to help protect inventions.

**Professional standards:** Attorneys must be registered with the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board. They are required to complete ongoing education, and are bound by strict professional and ethical standards.

**How they can help (for example but not limited to):**

* Assess whether an idea might be protectable by a patent and conduct prior-art searches.
* Draft and file patent applications in Australia, and advise on timing and jurisdictions aligned to business goals.
* Provide strategies to protect inventions and to monitor competitors' activity.
* Assist in patent office processes (e.g. examination, oppositions).
* Advise on other IP options (for example, designs, trade marks and protection of trade secrets).
* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.
* Monitor competitors and support steps to enforce rights.
* Assist with licensing and technology transfer.
* Conduct IP audits to identify protectable ideas and potential gaps.
* Advise on possible infringement risks relating to others' rights.
* Help you commercialise ideas in a way that supports business growth.

**What they don't do:**  A patent attorney cannot provide general legal advice and can't conduct proceedings in a court. If you engage an IP attorney, they would need to refer you to a lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.

### IP lawyers (including solicitors and barristers)

**Who they are:** Lawyers who specialise in IP law, which for some is regarded a distinct area of legal practice involving a focus on IP rights matters. \
In Australia, ""lawyer"" is a broad term that includes both solicitors and barristers. Most individuals and businesses will engage a solicitor as their first point of legal contact.

* Solicitors provide legal advice, manage disputes, and prepare legal documents.
* Barristers are specialists in court advocacy, representing their clients in court.
* An ""IP lawyer"" typically refers to a solicitor who specialises in intellectual property law and may collaborate with a barrister for litigation.

**Qualifications:** All lawyers must hold a law degree, be admitted to legal practice in an Australian jurisdiction, and maintain a practising certificate. Solicitors and barristers are separately regulated and may also pursue specialist accreditation in IP law.

**What they can do (for example but not limited to):** 

* Advise you on different areas of IP law, often including infringement, licensing, ownership, commercialisation, and enforcement.
* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.
* Draft and negotiate legally binding agreements such as licences, assignments, confidentiality agreements (also referred to as non-disclosure agreements or NDAs), and terms of use.
* Issue or respond to cease and desist letters relating to potential IP infringement
* Represent you in dispute resolution processes such as negotiation, mediation, and appearances in lower courts.
* Manage the legal aspects of an IP dispute and manage complex or higher court proceedings.
* Help identify and mitigate legal risks associated with creating, using, or enforcing IP.

It's a good idea to ask for an indication of how much the entire process may cost during your first meeting. IP lawyers have a professional obligation to provide you with an upfront estimate of their fees and costs.

**What they don't do:** Lawyers generally do not prepare technical IP specifications unless they are also registered as patent attorneys. Generally speaking, if your legal matter goes to court, solicitors will work with a barrister to represent you in court. 

By engaging an IP professional, they will aim to provide their services to achieve your intended outcome - but they are obliged to follow the instructions you provide them. While they can advise you on certain courses of action, you have the ultimate decision and responsibility.

### What is it?

IP Australia administers four types of IP rights

[Trade marks](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks)

[Patents](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents)

[Design rights](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/design-rights)

[Plant breeder's rights](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights)

There is no such thing as a worldwide IP right as IP rights are territorial and must be filed in each country where protection is sought. IP rights only apply in the countries or regions where they are granted. Australian registrations do not cover activities beyond Australia's borders. 

If you plan to sell, license or manufacture overseas, you can seek similar rights in other countries so businesses in those countries cannot legally copy your idea. 

These are some of the main ways you can apply for protection overseas: 

* You can **directly lodge separate applications with each country's IP office**. You will usually work with a local expert (an IP lawyer or patent attorney or trade mark attorney) who understands that office's rules.
* **International systems**:
* **Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)** for patents gives a single international application up to 30 months (or 31 months in some countries, like Australia and New Zealand) from the first filing date ('priority date') before you need to choose specific countries to apply in ('national phases').
* **Madrid System (Madrid Protocol)** for trade marks covers 131 member countries under a single application, enabling extension of your Australian trade mark abroad.
* **Hague System (Hague Agreement)** for design rights allows one international design right application to be extended to 92 member countries. Note that Australia is not a contracting party to the Hague Agreement, and that Australians need to meet [eligibility criteria](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/international-ip/international-cooperation/the-hague-system)  to use the Hague System.
* **Copyright registration** -- While copyright is automatic in all Berne Convention countries, some jurisdictions (for example, the United States Copyright Office) allow or require a simple registration or recordation to strengthen enforcement.

International protection can be costly and complex, so planning early helps you focus on the markets that matter most. You may wish to speak with an IP professional experienced in the overseas jurisdictions you are considering.",,"Can I protect my ideas in other countries?

Australian businesses that discover their intellectual property (IP) is being infringed overseas face unique challenges. By understanding these challenges, they can make informed decisions about how to protect their IP internationally.
Australian businesses that discover their intellectual property (IP) is being infringed overseas face unique challenges. By understanding these challenges, they can make informed decisions about how to protect their IP internationally.

One key point to keep in mind is that IP rights are territorial in nature.

IP that requires registration, such as trade marks, patents, designs, and plant breeders' rights, only provides protection in the country where it is registered. Applying for and registering with IP Australia does not extend IP rights protection to other countries.

**For example,** Sarah registers a design for a chair in Australia. When she discovers that a Chinese manufacturer is copying her product, she finds that her Australian design registration offers no protection within China. Although a registered design can prevent the copied product from being imported into Australia, to take formal legal action within China, she would first need to obtain a Chinese design patent.

Copyright, however, can be protected in several countries under specific conditions. If the copyright material was created and protected in Australia, it will also be protected in countries that acknowledge its protection through international treaties.

**For example,** Alec discovers that someone has been reproducing his painting in the UK. He could take action in the UK for copyright infringement of his artistic work, as both Australia and the UK recognise the protection of copyright in each other's countries.

### Key considerations for overseas infringement

If you find that someone is using your intellectual property overseas, consider:

**1. Do you have IP rights in that country?**

Before taking action, ensure that you have registered your IP rights in the relevant country. Without local protection, your options for enforcement are limited.

When protecting your IP in Australia, it is a good time to consider filing for protection in other countries as well. When deciding where to seek protection, consider filing in countries where you manufacture products, where you sell or intend to sell, where you may encounter copying risks, or where your competitors are based. The cost of obtaining protection in multiple countries can be significant, so most businesses need to prioritise based on commercial importance and risk.

For some IP that requires registration, specifically patents and trade marks, the World Intellectual Property Organisation can facilitate the filing of applications in multiple countries. See [How to Apply for IP Overseas](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/international-ip/how-to-apply-for-ip-overseas)  for more information.

**2. Different laws and enforcement standards**

Every country has its own IP laws, registration requirements, court systems, and enforcement practices. What might be viewed as infringement in Australia could be treated differently elsewhere.

**For example,**the protection of trade marks can vary significantly. Some countries, like China, Indonesia, or Thailand, follow a first-to-file system, where rights are generally granted to the first person to register the trade mark, regardless of whether they have used it in the market. In Australia, prior use of a trade mark can provide protection and rights, allowing a party that used a mark first to oppose or seek cancellation of a later registration.

Such differences can create issues for businesses expanding internationally. Consider a business owner, Sean, who sells branded shoes in Australia under the name 'Voice'. Later, he discovers that someone in China is selling shoes under the same name. Upon further investigation, he finds that this person has registered 'Voice' as a trade mark for shoes in China. Because China operates under a first-to-file system, Sean would likely encounter challenges in contesting the Chinese trade mark registration.

**3. Costs and practical challenges**

Overseas enforcement can involve significant expenses that exceed your expectations. You will likely need to engage local legal representation since foreign lawyers are generally not permitted to appear in the courts of other countries. Translation costs can be substantial, especially in countries where all documents must be officially translated. Foreign legal procedures can be challenging to navigate and may lead to significantly higher legal fees.

**4. Online infringement crosses borders**

The internet has made the territorial nature of IP rights more complex. A website selling infringing products might be hosted in one country, operated from another, and cater to customers globally. This situation creates practical challenges in determining where to take action. Generally, it's most effective to focus on where the most damage occurs. Consider where your customers or the infringers are located.

Online marketplaces present both challenges and opportunities. While infringers can easily reach customers through platforms like Amazon, many of these platforms have established procedures for addressing IP complaints and assist in removing infringing material or listings.",,"Addressing Overseas Infringement

### Enforcement options

When addressing overseas infringement, you have a range of options, each carrying different costs and likelihood of success. Some options include:

**Direct negotiation.**Sometimes, a letter of demand from local lawyers can resolve matters without the need for court proceedings. This is often the most cost-effective first step.

**Platform takedown notices.**Many e-commerce platforms have IP complaint procedures for online infringement, enabling rights holders to request the removal of infringing listings.

**Customs enforcement.**Countries like Australia allow IP rights holders to register with customs authorities, which enables officials to identify and seize infringing goods at the border. This can be particularly effective for physical products being imported.

**Legal proceedings.**Court action is appropriate when the infringement is causing significant commercial damage or when other methods have been unsuccessful. Legal proceedings should be a last resort due to their costs, complexity, and uncertainty in foreign legal systems.",,"Addressing Overseas Infringement

### Practical tips

Preventing issues is always better when it comes to international IP protection. Consider filing for protection in key markets early, ideally before launching products or services. While this requires an upfront investment, it's generally far less costly than trying to stop infringement once it has already begun.

Addressing overseas IP infringement is a complicated and often costly process. Consider consulting an IP lawyer who specialises in international IP protection and enforcement. They can offer specific advice tailored to your situation and help you craft a cost-effective international IP strategy. While it's frustrating to see your IP copied internationally, weigh the costs against the potential benefits carefully. Focus your resources on protecting key markets where enforcement is practical and commercially justified.",,"Addressing Overseas Infringement

### What is it?

If someone has accused you of infringing their registered trade mark,and you believe their trade mark has not been used in the market on the goods and/or services specified in their registration for more than 3 years, you may consider submitting a request to remove the trade mark on the basis of non-use.

You can request removal of a trade mark if you believe the owner:

* hasn't used the trade mark in relation to all or some of their goods and/or services for 3 years
* never intended to use the trade mark
* hasn't used the trade mark in good faith.

**When can you file an application for removal for non-use?**

If you are filing an application for removal on the ground that the owner never intended to use the trade mark, then the application may be made at any time after the subject trade mark has been filed.

If you are filing an application for removal on the ground that the trade mark has not been used, the following timeframes would apply:

| **For trade marks with a filing date 23 February 2019 or earlier;** | **For trade marks with a filing date 24 February 2019 or later;** |
| --- | --- |
| You can file after **5 years** or more have passed since the *filing date* of the application (and if you believe that a trade mark hasn't been used in three years.)

### What are the benefits?

* A successful application to remove a trade mark from the register removes the other party's rights to the trade mark that is allegedly being infringed.
* It can a simple, fast and low-cost option when a registered trade mark in question. If your application to remove a trade mark on the basis of non-use is unopposed, your request will be actioned following the two-month opposition period.
* In about 60% of cases, removal applications will not lead to an adversarial process, as those who are genuinely not using their trade marks typically do not oppose the application for removal.
* This process is also accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.",,"Request IP Australia remove an unused trade mark to defend your right

### What are the risks?

* When applying to remove the other party's trade mark from the register on the basis of non-use, the owner of the trade mark will be notified of your application and details within one month of filing. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the other party be aware of your identity and actions.
* Due to the public nature of these procedures there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to submit an application to remove the other party's trade mark should be considered as part of your IP or brand protection strategy.
* Any person can oppose your request for removal within 2 months of the publishing date and tell IP Australia that they disagree that the trade mark has not been used. If you wish to respond to the opposition and establish that there is a case for removal based on non-use, this will lengthen the removal process and take up further cost, time and efforts.
* A party who is dissatisfied with IP Australia's decision can also appeal it to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART), or Federal Court or the Federal Circuit and Family Court, which could be highly time-consuming and costly.",,"Request IP Australia remove an unused trade mark to defend your right

### What are the possible outcomes?

If the application for removal is advertised and no one opposes it within the required time:

* The trade mark will be completely removed from the Register, or
* The trade mark will partially be removed from the Register, namely in relation to the goods and services as specified in your application for removal.

If the other party opposes your request to remove their trade mark within the two-month opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition.

The person opposing the removal of the trade mark is required to establish, by filing evidence, that they have used the trade mark for the goods and services which are the subject of the removal application or that there are other circumstances justifying the non-use of the mark.

IP Australia will follow the processes prescribed in the law to decide the outcome, which could be any of the following:

* The trade mark will be completely, or partially, removed from the Register (as above).
* The Registrar decides the trade mark should remain registered.
* In rare cases, the scope of the registered mark is limited in some way (e.g. to a specific territory).",,"Request IP Australia remove an unused trade mark to defend your right

### What might the costs be?

There is a fee of $350 for filing the removal application. The process can, however, incur further costs when your application is opposed. For instance, IP Australia may decide in favour of the opposition and require you to pay the other party's costs.

### How much time might be involved?

The length of this process largely depends on whether someone opposes your application to remove for non-use.

If nobody opposes the application for removal within two months, the registration will be removed.

If the application to remove is opposed, the timing is similar to other [opposition processes](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/challenge-registration-trade-mark) involving trade mark matters.

### What is it?

If you are being accused of infringing someone's IP *outside*Australia, there may be some specific considerations to bear in mind - beyond those when dealing with Australian infringement issues. The location of the alleged offending might affect how you choose to respond.  

**This page provides an overview of considerations when being accused of infringing overseas.**   

Different countries have different IP laws. For registered rights, Australian IP registration does not specifically provide protection in overseas markets. It may be possible to infringe someone's IP in an overseas market even if you hold an Australian IP registration or are not infringing anyone else's IP rights in Australia. 

At a general level, IP infringement considerations can in many jurisdictions be quite similar to those which apply in Australia, and in considering your options may explore matters such as: 

* whether you have engaged in any activities within the relevant overseas market
* whether you have otherwise done any of the things that have been alleged against you
* whether the person making the allegations against you holds the IP rights they say they hold
* whether the things you have done involve infringement of IP rights held by that person (applying the laws of the relevant jurisdiction)
* what would be a good commercial outcome for you in resolving or addressing the allegations made against you
* whether you may be entitled to register your own IP in the relevant country to bolster you position against the other person
* whether you are open to engaging in negotiations, or alternative dispute resolution processes such as mediation, to reach an agreement with the person making allegations against you
* whether you may be prepared to go to court or similar to protect your commercial position regarding the allegations against you
* what the cost implications for any option available to you may be.

It is important to understand that the law and legal processes in each jurisdiction will vary around the world. What may not be considered IP infringement in one country, may potentially be in another. Similarly, what makes for a good strategy to address infringement allegations in one country, may not operate in exactly the same way in another. 

The IP First Response tool provides information about Australian IP law. If you are accused of infringing IP outside of Australia, you may wish to speak to a lawyer who is qualified to advise on the law of that country in which you are being accused of IP infringement. Australian IP lawyers and IP attorneys may be able to help you with referrals for foreign lawyers and otherwise assist you to communicate and engage with foreign lawyers.",,"Considerations when responding to international accusations

### What are the benefits?

Responding with due consideration to overseas threats reduces risks of negative outcomes and may mean a more suitable response, limiting investment of resources as much as possible.  

Should you choose to engage a local legal IP lawyer or IP attorney from the country where you have been accused of infringement, you may see the following benefits: 

* In most cases, engaging an IP lawyer or IP attorney is likely to reduce the risks you may encounter in enforcing your IP rights.
* IP lawyers can provide a wide range of legal services and develop a holistic IP enforcement strategy suited to your IP and business goals, and IP attorneys can provide specialist IP advice in their areas of expertise such as trade marks or patents.
* They have the knowledge, training and experience in the relevant jurisdiction to guide you through a dispute or a conflict which can be highly stressful and draining.
* They have an in-depth knowledge of relevant legislation and industry practices surrounding IP in the relevant jurisdiction, with the ability to leverage both appropriately and proportionately.
* They are able to recognise common issues which come up and refer you to other professionals when needed.",,"Considerations when responding to international accusations

### What are the risks?

* Failing to respond appropriately to accusations of overseas infringement can reduce your entitlement to some kinds of IP in overseas markets, your existing market presence and potential for future expansion.
* If you do not respond appropriately to accusations of infringement in foreign jurisdictions, there is a risk of having a court decision against you in the relevant jurisdiction, which may then be enforceable in Australia, jeopardising your interests and market position in the domestic market as well.

### What is it?

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) allows you to settle disputes without going to court. There are various types of ADR, most notably procedures such as mediation, arbitration and expert determination. These processes typically help resolve disputes through an experienced, impartial person providing opinions, facilitating an agreement between parties and/or providing a binding or non-binding decision. 

You can also use ADR at any stage of your IP dispute. ADR procedures and services are offered by a wide range of public and private bodies such as courts, tribunals and legal practitioners. Below are most common forms of ADR you may like to consider in resolving your IP dispute. 

**Mediation** 

Mediation is a structured negotiation process where the parties, with the assistance of an independent person as mediator: 

* listen to each other and are heard by each other
* identify the disputed issues
* work out what everyone agrees on
* develop options to address the disputed issues
* aim to reach a workable agreement.

The mediator has no determinative power to decide the outcome of the dispute - instead, the mediator will assist and advise both parties in shaping the mediation process and facilitating an agreement. Find more information about [mediation](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/mediation).

**Arbitration** 

Arbitration is a process where you and the other parties present the points being contended and facts to an independent person (the arbitrator). The arbitrator, who is often someone with a high level of expertise in the relevant field of law, then makes a decision based on the information received (an arbitral award). Notable features of arbitration include:  

* A more formal and structured process than other types of ADR, akin to a shorter and more flexible version of a court or tribunal hearing
* The parties are typically expected to produce evidence and submissions before the arbitrator. Both parties must agree before the process commences that the arbitrator's decision will be binding and enforceable
* Parties are in most cases required to renounce all other related legal claims to avoid going to court after arbitral decisions.

Many contracts stipulate that parties must resolve disputes through arbitration. Arbitration can also be voluntary or required under a court order.

Find more information about [arbitration](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/arbitration). 

**Expert determination** 

Expert determination is a process where one or more independent experts in the specialist area make a determination on matters referred to them. Expert determination is a highly flexible and collaborative procedure, and its notable features include: 

* The process is initiated by agreement between the parties
* The parties decide the issues that are to be referred to the expert to make a determination on

### What are the benefits?

While this varies depending on the ADR process used, ADR generally offers the following benefits over more formal dispute resolution through the legal system or courts: 

* Costs are lower than court proceedings
* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process
* More easily narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides
* Offers broader and more creative solutions
* Confidentiality, as decisions and records are not shared with the public
* Can have binding and enforceable outcomes in the form of contract or arbitral award.",,"resolve conflicts with the help of experienced facilitators

* The level of enforceability of outcomes and the availability of appeals or challenges may differ depending on the specific ADR process (for example, in some cases, a party may be able to have an arbitral award annulled or set aside, or a court may refuse to enforce to enforce an arbitral award in a limited number of circumstances).

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

If other efforts to resolve a dispute are unsuccessful or not appropriate in your situation, you may consider starting a legal action in court. Going to court is usually a last resort. Court proceedings are often expensive, time-consuming and stressful, and obtaining the outcome you seek is never guaranteed. 

**It is prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a court action.** You will likely also need assistance from an IP lawyer should you decide to start a court action.   

Courts can hear many types of trade mark disputes including:  

* actions against someone for infringing your trade mark
* matters relating to someone else's trade mark registration
* appeals from decisions made by IP Australia.

Trade mark proceedings in Australia are typically started in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal Court of Australia.

### What are the benefits?

* If you succeed, a court can award damages or compensation for losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made by an infringer through their infringement).
* Court decisions are binding and enforceable.
* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.
* You can often resolve several related matters in one case.
* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.
* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.
* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage the other party to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid the court proceedings continuing.
* For infringement claims, a court can, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent the other party from continuing to infringe your IP rights.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the risks?

* The outcome can be unpredictable.
* While a court can determine matters of law, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.
* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you.
* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties if you are wholly (or partially) unsuccessful.
* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you.
* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful and time-consuming and distract from the operation of your business
* Court proceedings are usually public, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.
* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.
* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.
* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).
* You may not be able to bring a legal claim if you have agreed in a contract that you will use, or that you will first try, an alternative form of dispute resolution.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the possible outcomes?

here are a wide range of possible outcomes, and these will also depend on the type of court action you might take. Some possible outcomes are:  

* You might reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.
* The other party might not respond or participate in the court proceedings, in which case the court might decide in your favour.
* The other party's trade mark registration might be cancelled, removed or amended.
* The court might decide against you, in which case your trade mark registration could be cancelled, removed or amended and you may need to pay some or all of the other party's legal costs.
* You could be awarded damages or compensation.
* A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your IP rights - including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter (see [Seek an urgent injunction](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/Interim_Injunction)).
* A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.
* Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims for *passing off* or under the Australian Consumer Law).

In most cases, the outcome can be appealed to a higher court.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What might the costs be?

Infringement and other court proceedings are generally very expensive as legal representation is usually involved and they can take a long time to resolve. Companies in particular are generally required by court rules to be represented by legal practitioners.  

Legal fees and the cost of expert witnesses usually make up most of the cost. 

It is common for the costs of trade mark-related litigation in the Federal Court of Australia to exceed $100,000.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

Court - Trade mark

### How much time might be involved?

Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, which court hears your claim, and the backlog of matters before that court. 

Trade mark claims are typically heard by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed *intellectual property* as the cause of action, were as follows: 

* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months
* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months
* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1

**The timeframe is typically shorter if the matter is resolved through negotiations or a court-ordered mediation process.** 

If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.   

Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.   

**Limitations on how long you can take to file an action** 

There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start.  

* The limitation period for a trade mark infringement action in most Australian states is six years from the date on which the first act of infringement took place, with the exception of Northern Territory where the limitation period is three years.
* If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.

Due to these complexities, it may be helpful to speak to an IP lawyer about time limits.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### How much is this used?

Trade mark proceedings are not particularly common in Australia because they can be expensive and time consuming for the parties involved. However, they are more common than some other types of intellectual property disputes like patent proceedings. 

In the 2023-24 financial year, there were 77 trade mark filings in the Federal Court of Australia2

### What you need to proceed?

Here are some things you might consider before you proceed with legal action in a trade mark matter. 

**Finding an IP lawyer for advice and representation**\
Court proceedings can be an expensive, time-consuming, stressful, complicated process that can have serious impacts on you and your business. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.  

**Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim**\
Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.  

**Decide who you intend to commence proceedings against**\
More than one person can be liable for IP infringement. A legal representative can help you decide who should be a party to a dispute.  

**Consider the impact of publicity**\
Unless covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents read in open court will become available to the public.   

**Gather all your documents**\
Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences and correspondence that you think might be relevant to your case. You can give these to your lawyer to review.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What is it?

Different countries have different IP laws. Australian IP registration does not usually protect against overseas infringement. If your IP is being infringed overseas you might need to consider different enforcement methods specific to those jurisdictions. Enforcing your IP overseas can be complicated, but there are still a wide range of options available.   

For Australian copyright material, a key factor in determining whether it is protected overseas is whether the overseas territory is a party to one of the relevant copyright conventions to which Australia is also a party. Most countries grant copyright protection to Australian material under international treaties. Further information about the international copyright treaties and conventions that Australia is party to is available on the Attorney-General's Department website: [Copyright basics | Attorney-General's Department](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/copyright/copyright-basics). Australia has also entered into a number of free trade agreements (FTAs) with individual countries and groups of countries. Many of these FTAs include agreed rules on copyright. 

**This page provides an overview of considerations when facing overseas infringement.**  

Actions you can consider against an overseas infringer will depend on the jurisdiction and the type of IP you own, but usually include:   

* **Informal enforcement** options such as sending letters, negotiations or online takedown notices. However, it might be more difficult to engage with international actors.
* **Strategic options** such as securing international rights for your intellectual property, partnering with local businesses, or other commercially-driven approaches.
* **Alternative dispute resolution** (ADR) options are also available. These can be organised directly with the suspected infringer, through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), or through services offered by the relevant IP offices.
* **Civil, administrative or criminal legal** enforcement options/schemes such as taking court action overseas. These will depend on the country/market involved.
* your entitlement to IP in those markets
* your existing market presence/potential for future expansion.

Without careful attention to the local operating environment, you may risk undermining your IP right. 

A local legal representative can help you understand these risks and how to mitigate them.",,"Considerations before enforcing your IP overseas

### What are the benefits?

* In most cases, engaging a legal professional is likely to reduce the risks you may encounter in enforcing your IP rights in another country.
* Legal professionals can provide a wide range of legal services and develop a holistic IP enforcement strategy suited to your IP and business goals.
* They have the knowledge, training and experience in their country to guide you through a dispute or a conflict which can be highly stressful and draining.
* They have an in-depth knowledge of relevant international legislation and industry practices, with the ability to leverage both appropriately and proportionately.
* They are bound by codes of conduct, professional standards and ethical obligations to act in your best interests, stay away from conflicts of interests and unethical conduct.
* They can recognise common issues which come up and refer you to other professionals and services you may not be aware of.",,"Considerations before enforcing your IP overseas

* Some legal professionals have different specialties and may be more effective in their particular field of expertise. For instance, one lawyer may be highly experienced in dealing with multi-national trade marks, but not so experienced with patent licencing deals, or vice versa.
* Once you engage a legal professional for their service, they are obliged to follow your instructions. While they can advise you on certain courses of action, you have the ultimate decision.

A critical step in assessing potential infringement is to ascertain if the suspected party holds any valid registered intellectual property rights that could provide them with legal rights in the country in which infringement is suspected. 

You can perform an initial check yourself - read about searching international IP registers [here](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/helpful-info-page ""Helpful info page"") - but you may need to hire a professional IP search service to do a complete search. The IP professionals listed below will often conduct these searches as part of their services as it will be a critical step to understand your position.  

**Contact a local representative or legal advisor in the relevant country** \
Seeking support from a local legal practitioner or IP professional may be necessary for some actions. A local representative can advise you on the options that are appropriate for you in the relevant countries, and will have the legal authority to represent you in that country.  

* Australian IP professionals with relevant international experience may be able to refer you to an overseas representative.
* Australian law firms often have offices operating internationally which can coordinate actions for you across each country.
* Government resources or reputable industry associations in the relevant country may provide a list of IP professionals you can contact.

While it may be useful to seek the advice of an **IP legal professional**(who can start legal actions such as court in the jurisdiction), you might also wish to consult an **IP strategic or commercialisation professional**about your general IP strategy including ways to protect and commercialise your IP overseas.  

Part of enforcing your rights in other countries, even in response to current suspected infringement, may involve registering your IP in another country. This consideration can be discussed with an IP professional familiar with the IP system in that country. 

**See what services the local IP office provides** \
Some international IP offices provide information on enforcement in their jurisdictions and may have services to help you with dispute resolution or enforcement. You can find out the relevant IP office and what services they provide using the [Directory of Intellectual Property Offices](https://www.wipo.int/directory/en/urls.jsp).",,"Considerations before enforcing your IP overseas

### What is it?

Mediation is a widely used type of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process where a neutral third party, called a mediator, helps parties negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. Mediation is a flexible, straightforward and often very efficient method to resolving IP disputes.  

Mediation can be used at any stage during a dispute process. It can be a preventative method used prior to an actual dispute, where parties may have encountered a roadblock. It can also be used in early stages of disputes, when parties fail to reach a resolution on their own. Lastly, you may even engage in mediation during more formal dispute resolution processes (that is, litigation or arbitration).  

While mediation can be ordered by court, it is often a voluntary process whereby disputing parties agree to negotiate an outcome with help from a mediator. Parties can discuss the suitability of mediation as a method to resolve their IP dispute and agree to participate in the process via different ways, including communicating directly through telephone discussions, email correspondence or instructing their legal representatives to do so. 

Mediation is an attractive option for parties who:  

* place a premium on the preservation or enhancement of their relationship, for instance when parties have an existing contractual or business relationship
* seek to maintain control over the dispute settlement process, with some flexibility to shape the mediation procedures without procedural rules being imposed by others
* value confidentiality, or

want to reach a speedy settlement without damage to their reputations.  

**When is mediation not appropriate?** 

Mediation isn't for everyone. Mediation may not be suitable when:  

* one or both parties need an impartial opinion on a matter of difference, perhaps to set a precedent or to be vindicated publicly on an issue in dispute
* a party is certain that it has a straightforward case to the extent that there is no room for settlement or negotiation
* deliberate counterfeiting or piracy has occurred.",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### What are the benefits?

* Costs and duration of the process is generally quite low.
* Mediation can be conducted across different jurisdictions.
* Less adversarial than other procedures such as arbitration and court proceedings, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party by reducing emotional strain and preventing the discussions from being too heated.
* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.
* Parties can narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides.
* Offers broad, productive or creative solutions to issues.
* Confidentiality, as the details of mediation and the resulting agreements reached are not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.
* Following a mediation outcome, it is open to the parties to the mediation to take further steps between them. This can include entering into a legally binding agreement that incorporates some or all of the outcomes from the mediation, provided the parties clearly intend and agree to it.
* Other enforcement processes often expect you to have negotiated in good faith before escalating (for example, a court is likely to require mediation be attempted before hearing a case).",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### What might the costs be?

The costs of mediation will typically include: 

* Mediator's fee
* Travel expenses and venue costs (if in person, though online mediation is increasingly common)
* Administrative expenses (that is, document preparation, correspondence, etc.).

The primary cost in mediation process is the mediator's fee. The hourly rate of a mediator would differ significantly depending on the subject matter of the dispute and whether you engage a private mediator or mediation services provided by court or other public bodies.  

While the fee for [mediation by a court officer](https://www.fcfcoa.gov.au/gfl/gfl-fees)  is $650 for each attendance, a [private mediator](https://mediationsaustralia.com.au/our-fees/)  typically charges $3,500 - $4,500 or more for a day of mediation.

Additionally, engaging an IP professional to act on your behalf will incur additional legal fees.",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### How much time might be involved?

Length of mediation processes can vary. 

It can be anywhere between hours to multiple sessions over a few months depending on factors such as number and complexity of issues at hand. While some commercial mediation would take no longer than a few hours or a full day only, mediation with [World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)'s Arbitration and Mediation Center](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/)  would typically [take 3-4 months](https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/amc/en/docs/wipoadr_patents-frand.pdf).

### What do you need to proceed?

Before you engage in mediation, you should think about whether mediation is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and what kind of mediator would suit your needs best. 

**How do I choose the right mediator?** 

It can be helpful to consider these questions when selecting a mediator to help ensure they are right for you:   

1. Would the parties like the mediator to provide a neutral evaluation of their dispute, or act as a facilitator of their negotiations?
2. What are the desirable professional qualifications and specialist experience of the mediator?
3. Is it more important for the mediator to have experience in the subject matter of the dispute, or the process of mediation itself?
4. Is more than one mediator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a mediation specialist as co-mediators?
5. Does a conflict of interest exist?

There is a wide range of mediation providers, ranging from government and public-funded bodies to private practitioners. Here's a list of directories and mediation providers that may assist you in finding a mediator you would like to engage:

### What is it?

[![See how Toyota uses the Notice of Objection scheme to stop counterfeit products entering Australia.](/sites/default/files/images/2025-10/Toyota%20button%202.png)](/node/257)

A Notice of Objection gives the Australian Border Force (ABF) permission to seize imported goods or copies of copyright material that are suspected to infringe on your trademark or copyright and are intended for commercial purposes. Without this legal document, the ABF cannot seize imported items that may violate your intellectual property rights. However, with your formal approval, even a single item that meets the criteria can be seized.   

If the importer claims the seized goods are legitimate and requests that they are released, it would become your responsibility to contest this claim and commence legal proceedings against the importer within 10 working days from the day the importer made the claim for release. If you choose not to take legal action, the goods will likely be released back to the importer. 

The scheme works better if you keep ABF informed about potential unapproved importation, red flags and recommended ways to spot counterfeits of your product(s) or copies of your copyright material. It may also be beneficial for you to update the ABF when any personal, business or IP information is added or amended. To ensure the ABF's registry contains only actively used trade marks and/or that it continues to cover your copyright material, you would be required to re-lodge the notice every 4 years to continue your protection.   

**Please Note:** A Notice of Objection [cannot act retrospectively](https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/files/fact-sheets/protecting-intellectual-property.pdf)  for goods/copies that have already been imported. 

[![Not sure if this applies to your situation?

D1002,Notice of Objection,D1002_03,93,"Stop infringing goods entering the country

### What are the benefits?

* Provides a way to intercept infringing imports before they enter the Australian market.
* Acts as a deterrent for anyone who tries to import goods that infringe on your trade marks.
* When caught, the vast majority of infringing importers abandon their goods.
* No financial cost to lodge the Notice itself.",,"Stop infringing goods entering the country

### What are the risks?

* You must agree to pay for costs incurred by the ABF which might result from the seizure of potentially infringing goods. Generally, costs are minimal.
* Failure to identify importers within your own supply chain may result in the seizure of your own imported goods.
* This action does not permanently resolve the issue of your goods being counterfeited.
* It doesn't take much for matters to escalate to court, potentially introducing higher risks and costs.
* Escalation of the dispute could require you to defend/reaffirm your claim to your IP rights.",,"Stop infringing goods entering the country

D1002,Notice of Objection,D1002_05,202,"Stop infringing goods entering the country

### What are the possible outcomes?

* The goods/copies are not detected entering Australia, or goods are detected but cannot be verified as potentially infringing; you are not notified.
* The goods/copies are seized entering Australia. You and the importer are informed.

The importer may then: 

* choose to abandon the goods/copies, which are then disposed of by the ABF, or
* file a Claim for Release of Seized goods/copies form.

If they submit this form, one of two things can happen: 

* you do not begin legal proceedings within 10 days and the goods are released to the importer, or
* you begin legal proceedings within 10 days.

The court's decision will likely result in either: 

* the ABF disposing of the goods, or
* the goods being released back to the importer.",,"Stop infringing goods entering the country

D1002,Notice of Objection,D1002_06,133,"Stop infringing goods entering the country
Notice of Objection

### What might the costs be?

While there are no fees to lodge a Notice of Objection, you will also need to lodge a Deed of Undertaking. This is a formal agreement to repay the ABF's costs resulting from any seizures made (e.g. transportation, storage and destruction costs).  

If you choose to take legal action against the importer, you will need to cover the costs of the legal action. Depending on the court's determination you may need to pay other party's costs, possibly damages, etc.",,"Stop infringing goods entering the country

### How much time might be involved?

A Notice of Objection is valid for 4 years and ABF may seize imports at any point during this time. It can be re-lodged, or withdrawn if it is no longer required. 

If a seizure has occurred: 

1. The ABF will notify you and the importer. The importer has 10 working days from the date of notification to ask for the goods to be released.
2. If no response is received, the goods are deemed to be forfeited and can be disposed of 30 days later.
3. If the importer seeks to have the goods released, you will be notified and have 10 working days to start legal action against the importer.
4. If the ABF does not receive a court order maintaining seizure of the goods/copies within 20 days of legal action commencing then they are still required to release the goods to the importer.

### What is it?

 If you are accused of copying or infringing someone else's trade mark, it might help to register your own rights in the trade mark which they have claimed is copying/infringing. This can be especially applicable when the other party's claim seems baseless or the two trade marks are not sufficiently similar in your opinion. 

A trade mark identifies your unique brand, product or service from other competitors. It might be a logo, phrase, word, letter, colour, sound, smell, picture, movement, aspect of packaging or any combination of these. 

Registering a trade mark can give you an exclusive right to use your branding on specific goods or services in Australia. Your trade mark will appear on a public, searchable database. This may help you demonstrate your ownership if others allege you have copied their branding. 

You might have some rights to protect your trade mark even if it's not registered with IP Australia. However, trade mark registration makes defending your right to use your trade mark easier. It also increases your enforcement options.

### What are the benefits?

Registering a trade mark offers a range of benefits which can simplify the process of defending your IP rights. It provides:  

* Formal registered rights that may support your defence against alleged infringement (on the specific types of goods and services claimed in the application).
* Robust and universally recognised registration (within Australia).
* Clear evidence of ownership date to support your claims.
* Strong negotiating position for future discussions to resolve the dispute.",,"Register your trade mark

### What are the risks?

* Applications to register a trade mark are generally public (an exception is the early stages of TM Headstart). Your competitors might become aware you are trying to register your trade mark. They may take actions like trying to register their own similar trade mark, or oppose your application.
* Examiner objections may incur additional fees or require amendments which may compromise your branding in relation to the scope of goods and services the trade mark can claim or (in case of TM Headstart) its visual identity.
* You might discover that there is a problem with your trade mark, or that someone else has already registered a similar trade mark. This could mean you need to reconsider whether your trade mark is right for you.
* An Australian trade mark registration does not cover you in overseas markets.
* Registration does not apply retroactively to past use, so it may not resolve allegations of infringement before you applied.",,"Register your trade mark

### What might the costs be?

There are two main ways to apply to register a trade mark in Australia: 

* Standard application
* TM Headstart.

These have different costs and timeframes. 

**TM Headstart fees** 

Registering a trade mark through [TM Headstart](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/how-to-apply-for-a-trade-mark/pre-application-service-tm-headstart)  costs a minimum of $330. This covers submitting your pre-application (step 1), and finalising your application (step 3). If you need to make changes before finalising your application (step 2), this will add to your cost. 

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action |  | Fees (per class) |
| Step 1 - TM Headstart request |  | $200 |
| Step 2 - Amendments to an application (optional) | Change of trade mark representation (optional) | $150 |
|  | Addition of new classes (optional) | $200 |
| Step 3 - Conversion to a standard application (Part 2 fee) |  | $130 |

**Standard application fees** 

A standard trade mark application costs a minimum of $250. \
 \
Your fees will be lower if you use the [picklist](https://tmgns.search.ipaustralia.gov.au/). The picklist is a searchable list of 100,000+ goods and services categorised into 45 classes relevant to trade marks. This helps examiners to know exactly which goods and services you intend to use the trade mark in relation to.

### How much time might be involved?

While TM Headstart and standard applications have different ~~`~~ timeframes, registration of a trade mark takes **at least 7 months** to finalise. This is because a trade mark cannot be registered until at least 7.5 months after its *priority date* (usually the application date).

### What is it?

Arbitration is a type of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in which a dispute is submitted, by agreement of the parties, to one or more arbitrators who make a binding decision on the dispute (known as an 'arbitral award'). The arbitrator is often someone with a high level of expertise in the specific field of law relevant to the industry or subject matter of the dispute.  

Arbitration can be somewhat similar to a court or tribunal hearing, but often are a shorter and more flexible version: 

* Parties are typically expected to produce evidence and submissions before the arbitrator to make a decision.
* Usually, the parties to the dispute must agree before the process that the arbitrator's decision will be binding and enforceable.
* Arbitration is generally seen as an efficient, impartial, and enforceable process to resolve both domestic and international commercial disputes, including IP matters.

Arbitration may be voluntary, required under a court order, or as part of a contract - arbitration clauses are often added to contracts, stipulating that the parties resolve future disputes using this method.  

Arbitration requires agreement from both parties, which can be challenging to obtain after a dispute arises, especially in cases involving no prior contractual relationship. For this reason, where there are contractual negotiations, it is often advantageous for parties to consider including an arbitration clause in their initial contract.",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

D1029,Arbitration ,D1029_03,275,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party
Arbitration 
Agree to be bound by the decision of a highly qualified third-party assessment
### What are the benefits?

* The potential outcome(s) of arbitration are highly enforceable, as Australia is a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards ('the New York Convention'). Australia has implemented the New York Convention through *International Arbitration Act 1974* (Cth) and through uniform State and Territory statutes governing domestic arbitration.
* Arbitration can be conducted across different jurisdictions and arbitral awards are often comparatively easier to enforce in foreign jurisdictions under the New York Convention, which is an advantage over court proceedings for cross-border disputes.
* Parties can choose their arbitrator/s and have some flexibility and control over shaping the process (for example, through scheduling, rules of evidence and procedures).
* Parties can narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides.
* Parties can also choose arbitrators with sector-specific expertise in relation to the subject matter of the IP dispute, which may be preferable when the dispute concerns highly technical issues.
* The details and outcome of arbitration can be kept confidential, subject to the parties' agreement, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.
* Arbitration may offer a faster and more cost-effective alternative to court proceedings.",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### What are the risks?

* Arbitral awards are generally final with limited grounds for appeal, which can be a risk if the decision is unfavourable.
* In some cases, arbitration can become as expensive as court proceedings, particularly if complex IP issues require specialised arbitrators.
* The outcome of arbitration can be unpredictable as arbitration does not necessarily follow the rules of procedure and evidence applicable in court proceedings.
* Arbitral awards do not automatically set a *legal precedent*; the ruling of the arbitrator/s will apply to the parties to the dispute only.",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### What are the possible outcomes?

There are a wide range of possible outcomes, including but not limited to: 

* If parties to a dispute agree to resolve their dispute via arbitration, the arbitrator will make a ruling through an arbitral award at the conclusion of the process.
* Parties might reach a negotiated settlement prior to the arbitrator making an award and withdraw from the process.
* In some rare cases, the arbitral award can be subject to further court proceedings due to factors such as lack of validity in the arbitration agreement or the dispute concerning non-arbitrable subject matter.",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### What might the costs be?

The costs of arbitration will typically include: 

* Arbitrator's fee
* Administrative fees (i.e. filing fee) payable to the arbitral institution
* (Optional) Legal fees for engaging an IP professional to act on your behalf.

A considerable portion in the costs of arbitration process is the arbitrator's fee. The hourly rate of an arbitrator would differ significantly depending on the amount in dispute and which arbitration/arbitral institution the parties choose. Due to the high legal and subject-matter expertise required of an arbitrator, the cost of engaging them can be extremely expensive.   

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center provides that cases under the WIPO Expedited Arbitration Rules cost around [US$48,000 and cases under the WIPO Arbitration Rules cost some US$165,000](https://www.wipo.int/web/wipo-magazine/articles/what-does-it-cost-to-defend-your-ip-rights-38493)  (48% of such cases involving a three member tribunal and 52% a sole arbitrator). 

While legal representation is optional, very often parties to the dispute would choose to engage legal professionals to give advice and represent them. As such, the largest portion of arbitration-related costs is likely to be legal fees for engaging legal professionals.",,"Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party

### What do you need to proceed?

Before you engage in arbitration, you should think about whether arbitration is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and which arbitration types would suit your needs best. 

Some questions to consider before you take your dispute to arbitration:   

1. Is there an existing contractual relationship between the parties which requires them (such as through an arbitration clause) to take disputes to a specific arbitral institution?
2. If not, is the other party likely to agree to take the dispute to an arbitrator or an arbitral institution?
3. Does the dispute concern a highly technical matter which would benefit from having a decision-maker with a high level of expertise in the specific sector or technology?
4. Is the subject matter of the dispute considered arbitrable in relevant jurisdictions? Though most areas of IP are considered arbitrable in many jurisdictions, questions relating to validity or registrability of intellectual property are deemed as non-arbitrable in some jurisdictions.
5. Is there a clear benefit that can be achieved from having the matter heard under procedural and evidence rules different from those of court proceedings?
6. Is more than one arbitrator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a legal practitioner as co-arbitrators?

There is a wide range of arbitrators and arbitral institutions, ranging from public-funded bodies to private practitioners. Here's a list of directories and arbitral institutions that may assist you in finding an arbitrator/s you would like to engage:

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

If you need *immediate* action on infringement while waiting for a court determination, you can request an urgent court order. These orders are rare due to their serious nature and their urgency does not give the other party time to respond. 

Urgent action can include: 

* interim injunction
* search order (*Anton Piller order*).

**Interim injunction** \
An injunction**,**in the context of an Australian IP dispute, is a court order that can: 

* Stop someone from infringing your IP rights.
* Compel them to take specific actions to prevent further infringement.
* Freeze a party's assets temporarily, to ensure they can pay should a judgment be awarded against them (sometimes called a *Mareva injunction*).

An **interim injunction** is a type of injunction which can be granted without a full hearing. It's a temporary, short-term tool to protect your IP until hearings take place.  

* Interim injunctions are rare. They are granted only where there is a serious issue to be tried and monetary damages would not be an adequate response.
* Interim injunctions are usually ordered for short periods of time, often one or two days. After this time, all involved are required to attend court to determine whether the injunction should be continued.
* When an interim injunction is issued, the infringing conduct must stop immediately, even if it hasn't yet been proven. However, if it's later found that the injunction was not justified, you may need to pay compensation.
* Seeking an interim injunction is usually the first step in a broader legal case. Court proceedings are often expensive and time consuming. Considering the complexity of any legal strategy which involves an interim injunction, a lawyer or legal professional's advice may be vital before deciding to take any court action.

**Search order** \
A search order (sometimes called an *Anton Piller order*) is a court order that provides the right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. This is primarily intended to prevent destruction of relevant evidence.  

These are only granted in narrow circumstances, including that you have a strong case, and there's sufficient evidence that important material might be destroyed.",,"Seek a court order to prevent further damage while preparing for court.

### What are the benefits?

* **Rapid cessation of infringement.**By halting any infringement immediately, you prevent further damage to your IP, such as erosion of market share or brand reputation.
* **Increased leverage in negotiations.**The court's willingness to grant an urgent injunction sends a powerful signal to the defendant, which may affect future negotiations.
* **Preservation of evidence.**An urgent injunction often comes with additional orders that can include the preservation of documents, files or infringing stock.
* **Enforceability.**There are existing mechanisms in place to ensure people comply with court orders.",,"Seek a court order to prevent further damage while preparing for court.

### What are the risks?

* **Potential to pay damages.**If it later turns out the injunction was unjustified, the applicant may need to compensate the defendant.
* **Evidence threshold.**While the threshold for an urgent injunction is lower than for a final decision, you still need strong evidence outlining both the infringement and the urgency of the matter.
* **Escalation.**Seeking an injunction is a serious escalation of a conflict and may make it difficult or use other enforcement actions in future. Additionally, filing an interim injunction requires you to take further actions in court.",,"Seek a court order to prevent further damage while preparing for court.

### What are the possible outcomes?

* If the interim injunction is granted, the defending party must cease all activity suspected of infringing.
* This can be extended throughout the trial as an 'interlocutory injunction'. If the subsequent lawsuit is ruled in your favour, the defendant might then face a final, permanent injunction.
* If the subsequent lawsuit is ruled in favour of the defendant, you may be required to compensate the defendant for lost revenue due to the interim injunction. Additionally, you may be liable for subsequent legal costs, and the defendant is free to continue their previous activities.
* If the interim injunction is not granted, the defendant can continue their activities.
* If you continue taking court action for infringement/with the subsequent lawsuit, an injunction or damages may be granted at a later stage.",,"Seek a court order to prevent further damage while preparing for court.

### What might the costs be?

An interim injunction is often the first step in an infringement action/court process/lawsuit. 

While it is difficult to specify exact costs, the total cost of the lawsuit will likely be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. A large proportion of these costs will be legal fees for your legal counsel.",,"Seek a court order to prevent further damage while preparing for court.

### What is it?

Educating your customers to recognise and value your genuine product, service, or invention can help protect your brand or invention and reduce the risk of being copied. 

While it's a legal question as to whether something infringes your rights, it's often customer confusion that causes the most damage. Making sure your customers understand what sets your product apart -- and how to identify a fake -- can reduce that risk. 

For many types of IP rights, customer education supports both your marketing and IP strategy. It can help stop counterfeit or inferior copies from gaining traction and may make enforcement easier if you can show that your customers rely on specific brand cues. 

Customer education can include: 

* Sharing the story and authenticity of your brand through advertising
* Highlighting proprietary features of your product or service
* Explaining where your genuine products are from, like official retailers or country of origin
* Adding or promoting product validation tools--such as QR codes, security tags, or post-sale verification
* Informing customers that your product is protected (for example, stating 'patented', listing a trade mark registration number, using the ® symbol to indicate a *trade mark* has been registered, or using a © symbol to indicate *copyright*material (although the symbol is not required in order for the material to be protected by copyright)
* Equipping sales teams to explain the value and unique features of your genuine product.",,"Help customers differentiate between your products and lookalikes

Discovering that someone might be using your intellectual property without permission can be both frustrating and concerning. Whether it is your brand name, invention, design, or creative work, knowing how to respond appropriately is vital for protecting your rights while avoiding unnecessary costs and complications.
### First step, gather information

Before taking any action, take time to assess the situation: 

**Document everything.** Take screenshots, photographs, or make copies of the suspected infringement. Record dates, locations (including websites), and any other relevant details. This information could be crucial later. 

**Review your IP rights.** Confirm that your intellectual property is protectable under the law and that you own the IP rights you believe are being infringed.  

Examining your rights involves identifying the kind of intellectual property involved. These can include patents, trade marks, designs, plant varieties, copyright, circuit layouts, and trade secrets.  

Remember that the law specifies what qualifies as intellectual property. For instance,copyright law protects original creative expressions of ideas, but not the ideas themselves. If it lacks legal protection, you cannot enforce your rights against another party. 

Reviewing your IP rights may also involve checking creation dates and any agreements that could affect ownership.  

Some intellectual property rights require registration, while others are automatically protected as soon as specific conditions are met. For registered IP rights, including patents, trade marks, designs, and plant breeders' rights, ensure your registrations are current and enforceable. For instance, design rights in Australia require a two-part process to be completed to enforce them against another party. Additionally, confirm that the IP rights have not expired or need renewal.  

**Evaluate the alleged infringement**. Consider how the other party is using your intellectual property and what they are doing with it. Keep in mind that not all uses constitute infringement, and not all similarities qualify as infringement.  

For example, when it comes to trade marks, two businesses may legitimately use similar names if they operate in completely different industries and consumers are unlikely to be confused. 

Consider the specific types of IP infringement with our guides on [patent infringement], [trade mark infringement], [design infringement], [plant breeder's rights infringement], and [copyright infringement].",,"What to do if someone infringes your IP

### Consider your options

Next, consider your options with IP Australia's [IP First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/). The website provides information designed to help IP rights holders navigate IP infringement and the factors involved in pursuing various options. 

There are a variety of options available across a spectrum. 

![[image, spectrum of options]](/sites/default/files/images/2025-07/Picture1.png)

[**Take no immediate action**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/take-no-immediate-action) 

Sometimes, the infringement might be minor, unintentional, or not worth pursuing. Reflect on whether the infringement has a negative impact on your business and whether taking action could involve reputational risk. 

[**Direct contact**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/provide-opportunity-stop-infringement) 

A polite letter or email explaining your intellectual property rights and requesting that the infringement stop can sometimes resolve matters quickly. The infringement may be unintentional, and the other party might be willing to stop once informed. 

[**Sending a formal letter**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/demand-other-party-stops-infringing) 

A lawyer can draft a more formal letter outlining your rights, the nature of the infringement, and demanding that specific actions be taken to stop the infringement.  

[**Alternative dispute resolution**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ADR) 

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) enables you to settle disputes with the assistance of skilled facilitators. Mediation or arbitration can resolve disputes more quickly and cheaply than court proceedings. They offer opinions, facilitate agreements between the parties, or provide binding or non-binding decisions. 

[**Legal proceedings**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/court-trade-marks) 

Courts can address many types of intellectual property matters, and their decisions are binding and enforceable. Proceedings tend to be expensive and time-consuming, with the outcome never assured. However, it may be necessary for serious infringements or when other methods fail. Court action is generally seen as a last resort.",,"What to do if someone infringes your IP

### Getting professional advice

IP infringement can be legally complex. What may seem like a clear-cut infringement to you may not be as straightforward under the law. Before taking significant action, consider consulting an IP professional, such as a lawyer specialising in intellectual property. They can help assess the situation and provide guidance on available options. 

Professional advice is crucial because: 

* Incorrectly accusing someone of infringement can lead to legal consequences
* The strength of your case affects which response options are most appropriate
* Some actions have strict time limits
* The costs of getting it wrong can be significant.",,"What to do if someone infringes your IP

### What is it?

When seeking registration of your trade mark with IP Australia, there is a chance that a third party opposes the registration of your trade mark. If this happens, you will have the opportunity to defend your application by responding to the trade mark opposition.

After your trade mark application is formally *accepted*by IP Australia, there is a 2-month window in which someone can oppose the registration under various reasons outlined in the *Trade Marks Act*. There are many reasons for opposing registration, including that your trade mark is too similar to another trade mark, or that you applied to register your trade mark in bad faith.

Once your application has been opposed, you will have the opportunity to defend your application by responding to the trade mark opposition. If you do not defend your application, it will lapse and will not proceed to registration. You can respond to a trade mark opposition by lodging a *notice of intention to defend* at IP Australia. After this, parties to the opposition process submit relevant submissions and evidence to IP Australia and may request a written or oral hearing, or a written decision without a hearing before an IP Australia hearing officer, who will decide whether your mark can proceed to registration. 

The process is generally less formal or costly than going to court. Parties to the opposition sometimes use this process to negotiate a settlement, such as limiting goods and services or agreeing to co-exist in the market.",,"Respond to an opposition filed against your trade mark

### What are the benefits?

* Defending your application from opposition prevents your application from lapsing automatically and gives you opportunities to present your argument and evidence as to why the application meets the requirements for registration.
* Trade mark opposition and hearing processes are less formal and generally quicker than court proceedings in reaching an outcome.
* The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.
* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision.  This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.
* Hearing officers have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.
* The unsuccessful party may be required to pay the costs incurred by the other party during the opposition process. This does not, however, extend to commercial losses or damages.",,"Respond to an opposition filed against your trade mark

### What are the risks?

* If your defence is unsuccessful or if you choose not to defend, your trade mark might fail to proceed to registration or might need to be amended in order to be registrable.
* You might be required to pay the other party's costs.
* Due to the public nature of this process there is a risk of public scrutiny, negative publicity or reputational damage.
* If you decide to defend, you are choosing to engage with an administrative process with various stages of paperwork and requirements, each with deadlines and consequences for failing to meet the deadline. Failing to meet specific timeframes and submit documents and evidence in acceptable formats can jeopardise your defence.
* Even if you are successful, the opponent can appeal the decision and take the matter to court. This will occur additional expenses.",,"Respond to an opposition filed against your trade mark

     + It is also possible that the opposition was only raised in relation to part of the goods and services claimed under the trade mark, or the hearing officer considers that your defence or the other party's opposition is only partially established. In this case, your trade mark may still achieve registration for part of the goods and services you have specified in your application.
   * The opponent withdraws or abandons the opposition, including if you reach a settlement or the matter resolves commercially before a final decision is made.

### What is it?

IP protection means securing legal rights over the things your business creates, such as your brand name and logo, your products and packaging, your creative content, inventions or processes. These rights may give you exclusive rights to use or allow others to use your ideas and brand.  

In practical terms, IP protection can make copying less likely and give you options if you identify possible infringement (sometimes called 'suspected infringement' in legal terms). 

For a small business, protection can make it safer to invest in new products and marketing. It can also make partnering easier, because other businesses can trust that you control the key assets of the deal. Clear rights can increase business value and help you stand out from look‑alike competitors. 

What IP protection may allow you to do includes: 

* Take action to stop others using your brand to sell things without your permission through a registered trade mark.
* Take action to stop others making, using or selling your invention in Australia with a granted patent.
* Take action to stop others using the look of your product with a registered design.
* Control copying, sharing and public use of your creative works under copyright. Copyright protects the way you express an idea, not the idea itself.
* License or sell your IP to create income or expand into new markets.

Some IP rights come from registration, like registered trade marks, patents and designs. Others arise automatically under the law, like copyright, which protects original creative works from the moment they are created. Unregistered trade marks exist, however they are usually harder to prove and rely on reputation and the Australian Consumer Law. You can seek advice from IP professionals such as IP lawyers, trade mark or patent attorneys to understand what types of IP rights would best protect your business and get help in the registration process.  

IP rights are specific; they cover the goods or services you list, the invention you detail in your application, or the design you register. They also work country by country. If you plan to sell or manufacture overseas, you may need to look at protection in those places too. Systems like the Madrid System (an international system for trade marks) or the Patent Cooperation Treaty (an international system for patents) can help with seeking rights in multiple countries. 

Protection is only part of the picture. Using your brand consistently, keeping good records, and having clear contracts (for employees, contractors and suppliers) can help you keep control. If a contractor or an employee creates something for you, they may own the IP unless your contract says otherwise.  

Monitoring the market can alert you to suspected infringement early, when problems may be easier to resolve. 

**A binding determination of infringement comes from a court.** Many issues can be resolved earlier through discussions, online take‑down requests or other dispute resolution options. 

Different bodies play different roles. IP Australia examines and registers trade marks, patents, designs and plant breeder's rights, and runs processes like oppositions and hearings which allows people to disagree with IP Australia's decisions. IP Australia does not police or enforce private infringement disputes.  

Courts can decide legal disputes, but there are many ways to deal with legal disputes which avoid going to court. Qualified legal professionals can provide tailored help if you want to explore protection or enforcement options. 

If holding your edge in business matters - protecting your brand, products and content - exploring IP protection can make it safer to grow your business, and improves the value of your business. You can start small and add more protection as your business and budget grow.",,"What IP protection means for my business

This concept applies across all types of intellectual property (IP) rights protected under Australian law, including patents, trade marks, designs, copyright, and plant breeders' rights.
### What does infringement mean?

At its simplest, infringement occurs when someone uses another's protected creative work or invention without that person's permission or consent. Australian law gives creators and inventors legal protection and rights over their work. Australian IP law protects various types of intellectual creations. These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders' rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.  

When someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement. 

Think of it as using someone else's property without asking. Just as you would not use someone's car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.

### Why IP infringement matters

IP infringement matters for several reasons: 

1. **For IP owners**: Someone using your IP without permission can damage your business, cost you money, and weaken the value of what you have created.
2. **For businesses and creators**: Using someone else's protected IP without permission can lead to legal disputes, financial penalties, and damage to your reputation.
3. **For everyone**: Australia's IP system tries to balance rewarding creators with allowing new ideas to flourish. Respecting IP rights helps maintain this balance.",,"What is IP Infringement

This concept applies across all types of intellectual property (IP) rights protected under Australian law, including patents, trade marks, designs, copyright, and plant breeders' rights.
### Key elements of IP infringement

While different types of IP have their own specific rules, some common elements help determine if infringement might be occurring: 

**1. There must be protected intellectual property**

For infringement to occur, the creative work or invention must first be protected under the law. This means answering the question, 'What exactly is protected?' Different rules apply to different types of IP and protect only specific aspects of creation or innovation. 

Some types of IP, like patents, trade marks, and designs, must be officially registered with IP Australia to be protected. On the other hand, IP rights, such as copyright, are automatically protected when certain conditions are met. 

Importantly, IP rights must be in place that have not expired. The various IP rights last for different periods: 

* Patents generally last up to 20 years
* Trade marks can last forever if renewed
* Designs last a maximum of 10 years
* Copyright lasts generally 70 years after the creator dies
* Plant breeders' rights last up to 20 or 25 years, depending on the plant variety.

**2. Someone used it without permission**

The person or business must use the protected IP without proper permission (commonly called the alleged infringer). Without some form of ""yes, you can use this,"" using protected IP might be considered infringement. Permission might be granted through: 

* Written agreement allowing its use (called a licence)
* Written agreement to transfer ownership (called an assignment)
* Informal permission (verbal agreement or consent).

**3. What they are using is too similar**

When determining infringement, the material created or the activity of the alleged infringer is examined. The alleged infringing material or activity must be sufficiently similar to the protected IP to create a problem. How this is judged under the law depends on the type of IP involved. Different tests are applied to determine what constitutes a problematic level of similarity. 

* **For patents**: Are they using what a granted patent specifically describes and claims?
* **For trade marks**: Are they using a trade mark that is too similar and likely to confuse customers, and is it being used on similar goods or services?
* **For designs**: Does the product look too much like the protected design?
* **For copyright**: Have they copied a substantial part of the original work?
* **For plant breeders' rights**: Have they propagated or copied the protected plant variety?

**4. How it is being used matters**

How the IP is used is an important factor in determining infringement though the requirements vary by the IP type: 

* **Trade marks**: To infringe a registered trade mark, someone needs to use something similar to the registered mark to brand or identify their products or services in the marketplace. Mentioning the brand name in conversation or for informational purposes, or in non-commercial contexts, is generally not infringement.
* **Designs**: Infringement typically involves making, importing, selling, or using products that incorporate the protected design. While often commercial, infringement can occur in non-commercial contexts.
* **Patents**: Infringement occurs when someone makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports the patented invention without permission.
* **Plant breeders' rights**: Infringement is primarily in commercial contexts, involving production, reproduction, conditioning for propagation, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, or stocking of the protected plant variety.
* **Copyright**: Copyright infringement can occur in both commercial and non-commercial situations. Copying, distributing, performing, or displaying copyrighted works without permission can be infringement.

**5. When using someone's IP might be allowed**

Even if someone is using IP in a way that appears to infringe, there may be legal defences or exceptions that allow their use. Each type of IP right has its own defences. Here are some common defences: 

* **Trade marks:** Using your own name in business is a defence.
* **Patents**: Using a patented invention for experimental use, like research and testing, is a defence.
* **Copyright:** Using copyright material for research or study, criticism or review, parody or satire, or news reporting are defences.
* **Designs:** Making parts needed to repair a complex product is a defence.
* **Plant breeders' rights**: Using a plant variety for the purpose of experimentation, further breeding, like cross breeding, or using the variety for private and non-commercial use.",,"What is IP Infringement

### Example scenarios

Here are some general examples that illustrate potential IP infringement situations: 

* **Example 1**: A small business develops and uses a logo that closely resembles another cafe's registered trade mark. Even without the intention to copy, this similarity could constitute infringement if it might confuse consumers about the source of the services.
* **Example 2**: A manufacturer creates a product using a method that incorporates all the essential steps described in someone else's granted patent. This is likely infringement, even if they were unaware of the patent.
* **Example 3**: A website copies an image from another website without asking for permission. This may constitute copyright infringement, even if the website provides a source for the image.",,"What is IP Infringement

### Common misconceptions/myths about IP infringement

There are several misunderstandings about IP infringement that many people believe: 

* **""If I change it by 10%, it's not infringement""**: Each IP right has different tests for when something is too similar. No fixed percentage change automatically avoids infringement.
* **""I didn't know they owned it""**: Not knowing about someone else's IP rights usually is not a defence against infringement.
* **""I'm not charging for it, so it's not infringement""**: Even if you are not making money from it, using someone's IP without permission can still be infringement.
* **""I'm giving credit to the creator""**: Acknowledging the source of material does not necessarily avoid infringement.
* **""It's not registered, so I can use it ""**: Some IP rights, like copyright, do not require registration to be protected.",,"What is IP Infringement

Determining whether infringement has occurred can be tricky and often needs legal expertise. Courts make the final decisions on infringement cases, and many involve complicated legal arguments. Things that make it hard to assess include: 

* The complexity of IP laws
* Understanding precisely what is protected
* Judging whether something is too similar
* Knowing which exceptions or defences might apply
* Keeping up with changes in how courts interpret the laws.

### What is it?

This page explains when it may be helpful to speak to a legal professional, such as a lawyer or a trade mark or patent attorney, about an intellectual property (IP) issue. 

You don't always need legal professionals to deal with an IP problem. Some actions - like lodging a takedown request or filing a trade mark - can often be done by yourself, if you want to take the time to understand the requirements. But if things are complicated, if you are unsure of what to do, or you simply don't have the time to learn, then a legal expert can help you and may give you confidence about what to do next. 

Legal professionals may help with tasks like: 

* Working out if your IP has been used without permission (known legally as ['suspected infringement'](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/what-ip-infringement)).
* Writing or reviewing contracts or licensing agreements.
* Filing applications to register an IP right
* Dealing with issues from applying (including adjustments to the application during examination)
* Dealing with any opposition against a registered IP right.
* Starting legal action through the courts or responding to legal action against you.

**IP Attorneys vs IP Lawyers vs non-IP Lawyers** 

IP law is a special area of law on which some lawyers focus, in the same way some doctors can specialise in certain organs or diseases - Not every lawyer is a specialist in intellectual property.  

IP attorneys and IP lawyers are different professions, but there are some services they both offer. Some IP lawyers can also be IP attorneys, however not all of them are.  

![Venn Diagram showing the similarities and differences between IP attorneys, IP lawyers and other IP professionals](/sites/default/files/images/2025-09/diagram.png)

 

Both IP lawyers and patent or trade mark attorneys can act for you at IP Australia - for example paying fees, making changes to submissions, and corresponding with IP Australia on your behalf. However, IP lawyers are needed if your issue goes to court; going to court is something an IP attorney cannot do.  

**Getting a legal professional** 

Even if you don't end up needing formal legal help, a short consultation may help you decide on next steps. Some services offer free or low-cost initial advice. 

There's no official rule that says when to hire someone, it depends on your situation, confidence, and what's at stake. Many businesses only seek legal help when something's gone wrong. But getting help earlier can make it easier to protect your ideas and avoid costly mistakes later.",,"When do I need a lawyer or attorney to deal with IP issues?

### What is it?

A hearing at IP Australia is a formal, administrative way to resolve disagreements about IP rights such as patents, trade marks or designs. It's handled by a hearing officer from IP Australia who specialises in the relevant field of IP law. 

These hearings can deal with both *inter partes* (involving two or more parties) matters such as trade mark oppositions, patent oppositions or design challenges and *ex partes* matters such as an IP applicant challenging an examination decision made by IP Australia. 

The hearing officer decides the matter mostly on the written evidence and submission explaining the reason for the dispute, but you can also choose to present oral arguments virtually or in person. The delegate may ask questions during the hearing.  

**Process steps:** 

* **(*****For inter partes matters*****) File an opposition:** You initiate the opposition process by filing a notice of opposition with IP Australia and paying the requisite fee. Parties will then be invited to provide evidence.
* **Request a hearing:** You request a hearing, or a decision in writing and pay the required fee. Parties will be invited to present written submissions to support their case.
* **Hearing**: If you wish to have an in-person or virtual hearing, the hearing will be scheduled at least 14 days after the final evidence is submitted.
* **Decision:** The delegate writes a decision explaining the outcome. They may also order one side to pay some costs.

**Outcomes and next steps:** 

* The decision may uphold, refuse, or change the scope of the IP right/s in question.
* **Appeals:** If you disagree with the outcome, there may be avenues to appeal the decision to a federal court or the Australian Review Tribunal (ART) depending on the nature of the decision.",,"What happens in an IP Australia hearing?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

If other efforts to resolve a dispute are unsuccessful or not appropriate in your situation, you may consider starting a legal action in court. Going to court is usually a last resort. Court proceedings are often expensive, time-consuming and stressful, and obtaining the outcome you seek is never guaranteed. 

**It is prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a court action.** You will likely also need assistance from an IP lawyer should you decide to start a court action.   

Courts can hear many types of trade mark disputes including:  

* actions against someone for infringing your trade mark
* matters relating to someone else's trade mark registration
* appeals from decisions made by IP Australia.

Trade mark proceedings in Australia are typically started in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal Court of Australia.

### What are the benefits?

* If you succeed, a court can award damages or compensation for losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made by an infringer through their infringement).
* Court decisions are binding and enforceable.
* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.
* You can often resolve several related matters in one case.
* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.
* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.
* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage the other party to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid the court proceedings continuing.
* For infringement claims, a court can, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent the other party from continuing to infringe your IP rights.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the risks?

* The outcome can be unpredictable.
* While a court can determine matters of law, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.
* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you.
* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties if you are wholly (or partially) unsuccessful.
* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you.
* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful and time-consuming and distract from the operation of your business
* Court proceedings are usually public, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.
* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.
* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.
* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).
* You may not be able to bring a legal claim if you have agreed in a contract that you will use, or that you will first try, an alternative form of dispute resolution.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the possible outcomes?

here are a wide range of possible outcomes, and these will also depend on the type of court action you might take. Some possible outcomes are:  

* You might reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.
* The other party might not respond or participate in the court proceedings, in which case the court might decide in your favour.
* The other party's trade mark registration might be cancelled, removed or amended.
* The court might decide against you, in which case your trade mark registration could be cancelled, removed or amended and you may need to pay some or all of the other party's legal costs.
* You could be awarded damages or compensation.
* A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your IP rights - including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter (see [Seek an urgent injunction](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/Interim_Injunction)).
* A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.
* Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims for *passing off* or under the Australian Consumer Law).

In most cases, the outcome can be appealed to a higher court.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What might the costs be?

Infringement and other court proceedings are generally very expensive as legal representation is usually involved and they can take a long time to resolve. Companies in particular are generally required by court rules to be represented by legal practitioners.  

Legal fees and the cost of expert witnesses usually make up most of the cost. 

It is common for the costs of trade mark-related litigation in the Federal Court of Australia to exceed $100,000.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

Court - Trade mark

### How much time might be involved?

Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, which court hears your claim, and the backlog of matters before that court. 

Trade mark claims are typically heard by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed *intellectual property* as the cause of action, were as follows: 

* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months
* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months
* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1

**The timeframe is typically shorter if the matter is resolved through negotiations or a court-ordered mediation process.** 

If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.   

Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.   

**Limitations on how long you can take to file an action** 

There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start.  

* The limitation period for a trade mark infringement action in most Australian states is six years from the date on which the first act of infringement took place, with the exception of Northern Territory where the limitation period is three years.
* If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.

Due to these complexities, it may be helpful to speak to an IP lawyer about time limits.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### How much is this used?

Trade mark proceedings are not particularly common in Australia because they can be expensive and time consuming for the parties involved. However, they are more common than some other types of intellectual property disputes like patent proceedings. 

In the 2023-24 financial year, there were 77 trade mark filings in the Federal Court of Australia2

### What you need to proceed?

Here are some things you might consider before you proceed with legal action in a trade mark matter. 

**Finding an IP lawyer for advice and representation**\
Court proceedings can be an expensive, time-consuming, stressful, complicated process that can have serious impacts on you and your business. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.  

**Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim**\
Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.  

**Decide who you intend to commence proceedings against**\
More than one person can be liable for IP infringement. A legal representative can help you decide who should be a party to a dispute.  

**Consider the impact of publicity**\
Unless covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents read in open court will become available to the public.   

**Gather all your documents**\
Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences and correspondence that you think might be relevant to your case. You can give these to your lawyer to review.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

* **Coverage limitations and exclusions:** Like all insurance, IP insurance policies can be complex, with narrowly defined terms and exclusions - certain types of IP may not be fully covered. Additionally, insurers typically **do not cover disputes or infringements that are already known, in progress or on the horizon.**
* **Insurer control over litigation strategy:** When a claim arises, the insurance company may want to settle quickly to minimise costs, even if you would prefer to continue to fight the claim. In some cases, this can lead to a conflict between the insurer's cost-control objectives and your business goals. Additionally, some policies will require you to use the insurer's panel of approved attorneys - which may make it difficult or more costly to use your own preferred IP counsel (if you already have one in mind).",,"Coverage against potential future costs related to infringement

### What are the possible outcomes?

There can be both positive and negative outcomes from IP insurance.  

**Positives:**

* **Financial protection** in IP disputes, covering costly legal fees and potential damages or settlements.
* **Improved enforcement** of your intellectual property, as insurance may help fund actions against infringers.
* **Deterrent effect** -- the knowledge that you're insured may discourage potential infringers.
* **Enforcement coverage** for both asserting your rights and defending against claims.
* **Credibility boost**, offering reassurance to investors, partners, or stakeholders.
* **Stronger negotiating position** when resolving disputes.

**Negatives:**

* **High deductibles (excess)** may apply before insurance kicks in.
* **Premiums may increase** after making a claim.
* **Coverage limitations** depending on the policy terms -- not all types of disputes or jurisdictions may be included.
* **Insurer influence** -- the insurance company might want a say in your legal strategy.
* **Risk of declined coverage** if the insurer determines the issue isn't covered.
* **False sense of security**, leading to overreliance and mistaken belief that ""everything is covered.""",,"Coverage against potential future costs related to infringement

### What might the costs be?

As IP rights can be worth a lot, and IP litigation can be costly, IP insurance can be quite expensive. It should be noted that the cost of protection varies widely depending on the specific IP right to be covered. Additionally, you may need to pay a significant deductible (excess) before the insurance covers the case, which can be highly variable. 

A premium can range widely depending on the type of IP, business and type of coverage sought, and is often an annual rate.

This concept applies across all types of intellectual property (IP) rights protected under Australian law, including patents, trade marks, designs, copyright, and plant breeders' rights.
### What does infringement mean?

At its simplest, infringement occurs when someone uses another's protected creative work or invention without that person's permission or consent. Australian law gives creators and inventors legal protection and rights over their work. Australian IP law protects various types of intellectual creations. These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders' rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.  

When someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement. 

Think of it as using someone else's property without asking. Just as you would not use someone's car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.

### Why IP infringement matters

IP infringement matters for several reasons: 

1. **For IP owners**: Someone using your IP without permission can damage your business, cost you money, and weaken the value of what you have created.
2. **For businesses and creators**: Using someone else's protected IP without permission can lead to legal disputes, financial penalties, and damage to your reputation.
3. **For everyone**: Australia's IP system tries to balance rewarding creators with allowing new ideas to flourish. Respecting IP rights helps maintain this balance.",,"What is IP Infringement

This concept applies across all types of intellectual property (IP) rights protected under Australian law, including patents, trade marks, designs, copyright, and plant breeders' rights.
### Key elements of IP infringement

While different types of IP have their own specific rules, some common elements help determine if infringement might be occurring: 

**1. There must be protected intellectual property**

For infringement to occur, the creative work or invention must first be protected under the law. This means answering the question, 'What exactly is protected?' Different rules apply to different types of IP and protect only specific aspects of creation or innovation. 

Some types of IP, like patents, trade marks, and designs, must be officially registered with IP Australia to be protected. On the other hand, IP rights, such as copyright, are automatically protected when certain conditions are met. 

Importantly, IP rights must be in place that have not expired. The various IP rights last for different periods: 

* Patents generally last up to 20 years
* Trade marks can last forever if renewed
* Designs last a maximum of 10 years
* Copyright lasts generally 70 years after the creator dies
* Plant breeders' rights last up to 20 or 25 years, depending on the plant variety.

**2. Someone used it without permission**

The person or business must use the protected IP without proper permission (commonly called the alleged infringer). Without some form of ""yes, you can use this,"" using protected IP might be considered infringement. Permission might be granted through: 

* Written agreement allowing its use (called a licence)
* Written agreement to transfer ownership (called an assignment)
* Informal permission (verbal agreement or consent).

**3. What they are using is too similar**

When determining infringement, the material created or the activity of the alleged infringer is examined. The alleged infringing material or activity must be sufficiently similar to the protected IP to create a problem. How this is judged under the law depends on the type of IP involved. Different tests are applied to determine what constitutes a problematic level of similarity. 

* **For patents**: Are they using what a granted patent specifically describes and claims?
* **For trade marks**: Are they using a trade mark that is too similar and likely to confuse customers, and is it being used on similar goods or services?
* **For designs**: Does the product look too much like the protected design?
* **For copyright**: Have they copied a substantial part of the original work?
* **For plant breeders' rights**: Have they propagated or copied the protected plant variety?

**4. How it is being used matters**

How the IP is used is an important factor in determining infringement though the requirements vary by the IP type: 

* **Trade marks**: To infringe a registered trade mark, someone needs to use something similar to the registered mark to brand or identify their products or services in the marketplace. Mentioning the brand name in conversation or for informational purposes, or in non-commercial contexts, is generally not infringement.
* **Designs**: Infringement typically involves making, importing, selling, or using products that incorporate the protected design. While often commercial, infringement can occur in non-commercial contexts.
* **Patents**: Infringement occurs when someone makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports the patented invention without permission.
* **Plant breeders' rights**: Infringement is primarily in commercial contexts, involving production, reproduction, conditioning for propagation, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, or stocking of the protected plant variety.
* **Copyright**: Copyright infringement can occur in both commercial and non-commercial situations. Copying, distributing, performing, or displaying copyrighted works without permission can be infringement.

**5. When using someone's IP might be allowed**

Even if someone is using IP in a way that appears to infringe, there may be legal defences or exceptions that allow their use. Each type of IP right has its own defences. Here are some common defences: 

* **Trade marks:** Using your own name in business is a defence.
* **Patents**: Using a patented invention for experimental use, like research and testing, is a defence.
* **Copyright:** Using copyright material for research or study, criticism or review, parody or satire, or news reporting are defences.
* **Designs:** Making parts needed to repair a complex product is a defence.
* **Plant breeders' rights**: Using a plant variety for the purpose of experimentation, further breeding, like cross breeding, or using the variety for private and non-commercial use.",,"What is IP Infringement

### Example scenarios

Here are some general examples that illustrate potential IP infringement situations: 

* **Example 1**: A small business develops and uses a logo that closely resembles another cafe's registered trade mark. Even without the intention to copy, this similarity could constitute infringement if it might confuse consumers about the source of the services.
* **Example 2**: A manufacturer creates a product using a method that incorporates all the essential steps described in someone else's granted patent. This is likely infringement, even if they were unaware of the patent.
* **Example 3**: A website copies an image from another website without asking for permission. This may constitute copyright infringement, even if the website provides a source for the image.",,"What is IP Infringement

### Common misconceptions/myths about IP infringement

There are several misunderstandings about IP infringement that many people believe: 

* **""If I change it by 10%, it's not infringement""**: Each IP right has different tests for when something is too similar. No fixed percentage change automatically avoids infringement.
* **""I didn't know they owned it""**: Not knowing about someone else's IP rights usually is not a defence against infringement.
* **""I'm not charging for it, so it's not infringement""**: Even if you are not making money from it, using someone's IP without permission can still be infringement.
* **""I'm giving credit to the creator""**: Acknowledging the source of material does not necessarily avoid infringement.
* **""It's not registered, so I can use it ""**: Some IP rights, like copyright, do not require registration to be protected.",,"What is IP Infringement

### Why it's hard to figure out on your own

Determining whether infringement has occurred can be tricky and often needs legal expertise. Courts make the final decisions on infringement cases, and many involve complicated legal arguments. Things that make it hard to assess include: 

* The complexity of IP laws
* Understanding precisely what is protected
* Judging whether something is too similar
* Knowing which exceptions or defences might apply
* Keeping up with changes in how courts interpret the laws.

### What is it?

If you create a new look for a product, registering the design with IP Australia may grant you exclusive commercial rights. The registration protects the overall appearance that results from visual features such as shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation applied to a product. 

The process begins with an online application through [IP Australia's Online Services](https://portal.ipaustralia.gov.au/login). You upload clear drawings (or photographs) of the design, identify the product it is applied to, choose whether to seek registration immediately or defer registration, and pay the application fee. Australia works on a first-to-file basis under the Designs Act 2003, so applying before you disclose the design publicly can be critical. Once the formalities check is complete, the design is registered and published, and a public record is created 

Registration alone does not give you enforceable rights against suspected infringers. You, or any third party, may later request certification to test whether the design is new and distinctive over earlier designs. Only certified designs can be enforced in court; uncertified registrations provide deterrence but not immediate enforceability. For more information about design certification, please see [Request Certification for a Registered Design](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/request-certification-registered-design)  

A registered design lasts up to ten years: an initial five-year term that can be renewed once for a further five years. A six‑month grace period applies for late renewal after the initial term. 

If your design has been disclosed to the public before you apply to protect it, you may still be able to secure a design right if you meet the requirements of the grace period. The grace period allows a design to be shared publicly (under certain conditions) without impacting the ability to secure a design right in Australia. It can benefit those who: 

* Accidentally publish their design
* Were unaware they needed to file for protection before disclosure.

You'll need to **submit your application for a design right within 12 months of disclosing your design** if you want to claim the grace period.",,"Register your right to use your design exclusively

* Can help you find a mutually acceptable solution while preserving business relationships.

* Whether the parties would benefit from continuing their relationship

### What is it?

Third-party examination lets any person request IP Australia to conduct a formal examination of a registered Australian design. The examiner assesses newness, distinctiveness and compliance with formal requirements at the design's filing date. 

Requests may be lodged through IP Australia's Online Services or by post using the approved form, providing the design registration number, owner details and payment of the examination fee. A third party examination can be requested at any time, by any person who has an interest in the validity of design right. This makes it a versatile tool to: 

* respond to allegations that you have infringed against a registered design, or
* to question the validity of a competitors registered design pre-emptively.

Once filed, IP Australia notifies the owner of the design right and provide information about possible options.  

The design is examined by a designs examiner If the design does not meet the requirements, the registration may be revoked or reduced in scope; if it passes, the design becomes certified and fully enforceable in court proceedings.  

When submitting a request for third party examination, you can include documentation to support your argument. Documentation can include business documents, circumstances, general knowledge and evidence to support your argument.  

Examination can be requested any time after registration and before the design expires at the end of its maximum 10-year term (initial five years plus one 5-year renewal).  

**Formal action to protect design rights -- like sending a letter of demand (or cease-and-desist letter) -- can only be initiated after a design right is certified. A threat to start infringement or similar proceedings against another person in respect of a design will be an unjustified threat if the design has not been certified. A person who receives such a threat can start legal action against the person making the threat: see** [**Respond to an unjustified threat | IP Australia First Response**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/respond-unjustified-threat)**.**",,"Request confirmation that someone else's registered design is valid

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

An online takedown notice from an online marketplace may result in a listing for your product(s) being removed. If this occurs, and someone claims that your trade mark infringes theirs, major marketplaces offer different ways to dispute it or make your case for why you think it is wrong. Some examples from large marketplaces are: 

* Amazon and eBay provide a formal appeal or counter-notice process where you submit information showing your right to use the trade mark.
* Etsy does not have a dedicated trade mark counter-notice form; instead, you use Etsy's Intellectual Property report, receive the complainant's contact details by email, and may need to resolve it directly or seek legal advice.
* Shein offers an IP Notice portal: you file a report explaining your status, but there is no structured counter-notice form--Shein removes listings when notified and does not mediate between parties.

Each platform then reviews the submission and decides whether to restore or permanently disable the listing. 

While this is not a fully expansive list of marketplaces available, this outlines some of the responses that these marketplaces can offer. You can check the specific process from the relevant marketplace in question, if or when an infringement issue arises. 

Most e-commerce platforms and major digital advertisers/search engine providers have a notice and take-down mechanism for handling IP complaints, including those concerning counterfeit goods.   

Companies can list their IP rights with different e-commerce platforms before anyone tries to sell counterfeit goods. Some platforms, such as Amazon, invite you to add your trade marks and other kinds of IP rights to a brand registry. This is used in automated checks to detect infringing goods before they are even listed for sale.",,"Oppose an IP infringement notice from an online marketplace

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

You can consider reaching out informally to the party who you suspect to be infringing your IP, before taking any legal or formal action against them.  

In some cases, infringement can be unintentional or a suspected infringer might be open to reaching an amicable solution. 

Informal contact with another party can be effective at resolving IP disputes -- however, it can also open you up to a range of unexpected or detrimental results. Any consideration for informal contact should be weighed against the possible negative outcomes. An IP professional can help inform this decision.  

Before talking to the other party, you should be satisfied that the other party's actions would amount to infringement of your IP. This is something that an IP lawyer or an IP attorney can assist with. 

**There can be serious consequences if you threaten a person with infringement proceedings on an incorrect basis, including a risk that the party may sue you. You might be liable to pay compensation or damages or you may be ordered to stop making the threat under '**[**unjustified threat**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/respond-unjustified-threat)**' provisions (also referred to as 'groundless threats' in copyright law).**  

For more information about what constitutes an infringement, see our information on [what infringement can look like](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/infringement-101 ""Infringement 101 "").An IP professional can help you make this assessment. 

**Please note** **t****hat engaging in any informal contact with the other party before consulting with an IP professional can result in detrimental outcomes for you and your IP right. Please consider carefully if you want to undertake this action and are fully aware of the risks involved.**",,"Provide an opportunity for the other party to stop infringing.

### What are the benefits?

* Often cost-effective.
* Quick and easy to initiate.
* Possibility of stopping infringing behaviour without the need for additional stepsand the stress of more formal actions.
* Allows you to consider many options to escalate, if suspected infringement continues.

### What are the risks?

* **Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation, damages and costs resulting from the threat and in you being ordered to stop making the threat.**
* Using unreasonably aggressive or unprofessional tone in the communication with the other party may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply.
* Alerting the other party, regardless of the legitimacy of your claim, can expose you counterclaims or actions from the other party, which may escalate the conflict in an unwanted way. This could jeopardise your IP rights.
* For registered rights, it might prompt the other party to challenge the validity or registrability of your IP right in an attempt to undermine your claims.
* In the case of trade marks, the other party may apply for a trade mark as a defensive strategy against your claims, and you may then need to decide if you wish to oppose their application.
* Contacting the suspected infringer might give them time to hide or destroy evidence. This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, you should seek legal advice before communicating with the other party.
* Depending on what you say to the other party, or what you might agree with them, this could impact your ability to take other enforcement action in future. **It is usually prudent to tell the other party that any informal communications are on a 'without prejudice' basis and to include this in any written communications with them.**",,"Provide an opportunity for the other party to stop infringing.

### What are the possible outcomes?

Informal communication with the other party can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the specific circumstances. 

Some possible outcomes are: 

* The alleged infringing behaviour stops following the conversation, especially if the other party was simply unaware of existing IP rights.
* The alleged infringer does not change their behaviour, in which case you may have to consider other enforcement options.
* Parties can engage in further communication disputing part or all of your claims.
* The alleged infringer is placed on notice that their conduct may involve infringement, which may assist you to seek monetary compensation if you later commence court action.
* The conflict can further escalate into more serious, formal dispute settlement procedures (for example, sending a letter of demand, litigation, mediation, arbitration, administrative hearings.).
* The other party may not fulfil all the requirements but may be willing to participate in some form of negotiation.
* The other party may commence proceedings challenging the validity of the IP right, or be prompted to take legal action against you (for instance if they are of the opinion that you are infringing on their rights). This could include seeking damages or compensation for unjustified threats.",,"Provide an opportunity for the other party to stop infringing.

### What do you need to proceed?

Understanding what constitutes IP infringement, and possible consequences of contacting a suspected infringer, can help you decide if this is the right option for you. 

It's important to get all the factual details correct and evaluate the merits of your claims before you reach out to the other party. **Making unjustified claims of IP infringement can have serious consequences. If you are found to have made an unjustified threat, you might be liable to pay damages or compensate the other party or you may be ordered to stop making the threat.** 

For more information about how someone can take action against unjustified threats through the courts, please review [Respond to an unjustified threat | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/respond-unjustified-threat) 

Here are some things you might wish to check and consider before talking to the other party you should consider engaging an IP lawyer or IP attorney to work through these issues with you:  

* The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where suspected infringement occurred. This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the alleged infringer has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices.
* Whether the other party's conduct amounts to infringement, having regard to [what infringement looks like](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/heres-some-helpful-information-enforcement), to avoid making unjustified threats. For registered IP, it's worth considering the 'scope of protection' of your registered claim. 
  + For trade marks, this includes the goods or services attached to your registration, and whether the other party is offering similar goods and services.
  + For patents, it includes whether the product or process contains all the essential features of a claim in a granted patent.
  + For designs, the scope of protection would require consideration of not only the visual appearance of the product but the tangible physical product (e.g. a chair, a bottle, etc.) that the design is applied to.  \
    **Please note:** a design right can only be enforced if the right is also certified. For more information please see [Request certification for your registered design | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/request-certification-your-registered-design)
* The identity and contact details of the suspected infringer. It's important to make sure you speak to the correct party.

If you are not sure about any of the above, then you might want to speak to an IP professional for help. 

Before taking this action, it might also be helpful to consider your goals and potential outcomes, including:  

* Options for outcomes that would benefit or be agreeable to everyone involved.
* Whether you will be prepared to be engaged in further correspondence, negotiation or even disputes with the other party. If you threaten to do something and do not follow through, it could be found to be an unjustified threat.
* Your plans to commercialise and promote your IP, and whether making informal contact could undermine (or strengthen) these.
* Ways you can engage in an amicable, productive conversation with the other party.",,"Provide an opportunity for the other party to stop infringing.

### Consider contacting an IP professional for advice and assistance

It can be difficult to determine whether the other party's behaviour amounts to infringement and facilitate a productive, amicable discussion with the other party. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you make this assessment and advise what steps would work best in your situation.   

**Please note:** Making informal contact before consulting with an IP professional can result in detrimental outcomes for you and your IP right. Please consider carefully if you want to undertake this action and are fully aware of the risks involved.

### **Exercise caution before making accusations of infringement**

Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation or damages or an order that you stop making the threat. Proving infringement is an important issue that should be considered before you informally contact another party.  

*Before you take any action, you should consider whether you need legal or professional advice specific to your situation. It is important to know what rights you have, what remedies are open to you, and the cost and likelihood of success. IP Australia provides information on*[*getting professional assistance with your IP*](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/get-professional-assistance-with-your-ip) *.

### Legal protection for unregistered trade marks

Since unregistered trade marks are not protected under the *Trade Marks Act*, businesses may rely on two alternative legal frameworks. These prevent someone from gaining a commercial advantage by wrongfully taking the identifying attributes of another's business.1 

**1. An action for passing off**

The common law action of passing off protects the goodwill or reputation associated with an unregistered trade mark. A successful passing off action must prove:2 

1. A business has established goodwill or reputation in a trade mark or another identifying mark in Australia.
2. Another business has made a misrepresentation (intentional or not) that is likely to deceive or confuse consumers. For example, consumers are confused thinking that the goods or services come from one business and not the other.
3. The business has suffered or is likely to suffer damage as a result.

**For example,** a small café called ""Koala Brews"" operates in Brisbane for 15 years, developing strong local recognition in the name. When a new coffee shop opens nearby with a similar name and logo called ""Kola Brews"", causing customer confusion. The original café may have grounds for a passing off action. 

**2. Australian Consumer Law (ACL)**

*Competition and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth) prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct and false representations.3 These provisions can protect unregistered trade marks when: 

* A competitor's conduct misleads consumers about the origin of goods or services
* A business falsely claims association, sponsorship, or approval
* A business makes false representations about goods or services.

**For example**, a clothing manufacturer uses a logo that closely resembles that of a well-known Australian designer, leading consumers to believe they are purchasing the designer's products. Even without a registered trade mark, the designer may have grounds for an action under the ACL.",,"Unregistered trade marks

### Key differences between registered and unregistered trade marks

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Registered Trade Marks** | **Unregistered Trade Marks** |
| Protected under the *Trade Marks Act 1995* (Cth). | Protected through an action for passing off and the Australian Consumer Law. |
| Protection across Australia when registered. | Protection where reputation has been established in Australia. |
| Exclusive rights to use the trade mark for the registered goods/services. | Passing off protects a right of property in business or goodwill, whereas the Australian Consumer Law protects consumers against misleading and deceptive conduct.4 |
| Infringement does not require proof of reputation, misrepresentation or damage. See [trade mark infringement card] | The owner must prove reputation, misrepresentation and damage in court. |
| Longer-term protection (renewable every 10 years). | Protection exists as long as the trade mark is used, and the reputation continues. |

Navigating  the protection of unregistered marks can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Given that unregistered trade marks are not filed with IP Australia, experts can help work out what is protected and how it might be misused. Court actions for passing off and ACL violations can be more complex, time-consuming, and costly. Additionally, these actions may also be pursued in conjunction with trade mark infringement cases. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

### What is it?

If other efforts to resolve a dispute are unsuccessful or not appropriate in your situation, you may consider starting a legal action in court. Going to court is usually a last resort. Court proceedings are often expensive, time-consuming and stressful, and obtaining the outcome you seek is never guaranteed.

**It is prudent to seek legal advice before starting legal proceedings. You will likely also need the assistance of a lawyer with experience in IP.**

Courts can hear many types of design disputes including:

* Actions against someone for suspected infringement of your registered design. A certificate of examination from IP Australia is required before you can enforce your design in court.

* Matters relating to the validity of a registered design.

* Appeals from decisions made by IP Australia.

Design proceedings in Australia are typically started in the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2).

**Designs court cases are rare. This means there is limited legal precedent for judges and lawyers to draw on. This makes it harder to build a strong case, increases potential costs, and adds uncertainty to how a judge might rule.**",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the benefits?

* If you succeed, a court can award damages or compensation for losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made in relation to the infringement).
* Court decisions are binding and enforceable between the parties to the proceedings.
* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.
* You can often resolve several related matters in one case.
* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.
* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.
* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage the other party to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid the court proceedings continuing.
* For suspected infringement claims, a court can, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent the other party from continuing to infringe your registered design.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the risks?

* The outcome can be unpredictable.
* While a court can determine the dispute between the parties, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.
* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you, including challenges to the validity of your design.
* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties.
* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you. This can have implications for any costs you may incur.
* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful, time-consuming, and distract from the operation of your business.
* Court proceedings are usually public unless they are covered by a confidentiality order, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.
* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.
* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.
* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).
* If you intend to commence proceedings against a party that you have a pre-existing contractual agreement with, it may be important to consider whether the agreement covers ways to deal with IP disputes. For example, some agreements may require a party try forms of alternative dispute resolution before they are able to commence proceedings",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What are the possible outcomes?

There are a wide range of possible outcomes, and these will also depend on the type of court action you might take. Some possible outcomes are:

* You might reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.
* The other party might not respond or participate in the court proceedings, in which case the court might decide in your favour.
* The other party's registered design might be cancelled or amended.
* The court might decide against you, in which case your registered design could be cancelled and you may need to pay some or all of the other party's legal costs.
* You could be awarded damages.
* A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your design rights - including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter.
* A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.
* Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims under the Australian Consumer Law).
* In most cases, the outcome can be appealed to a higher court.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What might the costs be?

Infringement and other court proceedings are generally very expensive as legal representation is usually involved and they can take a long time to resolve.

Court proceedings can be expensive because they often involve lawyers and expert witnesses. Actual costs vary widely depending on complexity and procedure.

For comparison, simple patent-related litigation may cost [between $100-500k](https://www.twobirds.com/-/media/new-website-content/microsites/patent-hub/country-comparison-tool/australia---q,-a-,a.pdf), major patent litigation can cost in the millions. Appeals cost anywhere from $150k-300k+.

**Because of the lack of legal precedent for designs. It is likely that any designs dispute in court will be very expensive.**",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

D1087,Court - Designs,D1087_07,123,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions
Court - Designs
Escalate a wide range of design rights matters to court.
### How much time might be involved?

Court cases can take months or years to conclude, depending on complexity, the evidence required, and whether there are appeals. Interim injunctions (temporary orders to stop suspected infringement) may be available more quickly, but full proceedings generally take much longer.

The timeframe is typically shorter if the matter is resolved through negotiations or a court-ordered mediation process. 

If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### Limitations on how long you can take to file an action

There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start.

* The limitation period for a designs infringement action is six years from the date on which the act of infringement took place. The infringement act must also have taken place in the period of registration.
* If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.

Due to these complexities, it may be helpful to speak to an IP lawyer about time limits.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What do you need to proceed?

Here are some things you might consider before you proceed with legal action in a designs matter. 

**Find an IP lawyer for advice and representation** \
Court proceedings can be an expensive, time-consuming, stressful, complicated process that can have a serious impact on you and your business. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.

**Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim** \
Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.

**Consider the impact of publicity** \
Court proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.

**Gather all your documents** \
Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review.",,"Seek binding, authoritative decisions

### What is it?

.au Domain Administration (auDA) is a not-for-profit organisation that is responsible for administering the .au domain. If you believe someone's .au domain name licence is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can lodge a dispute with one of two independent resolution providers under auDA's .au Dispute Resolution Policy (auDRP). This can result in cancellation or transfer of the .au domain name licence.   

A panel of independent arbitrators and legal practitioners will consider submissions from both parties and provide their decision with reasoning, in writing. There are usually no in-person hearings and the panel's decisions are binding on both parties. 

**Please Note:** If the infringing domain name does not end in '.au' then you might consider accessing a different dispute resolution service like one under the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP).

Fees increase based on how many .au domain names are in dispute, and whether you choose to have the dispute heard by a panel of one or 3 panellists. If you choose a one-member panel, the registrant can elect to have the dispute heard by a 3-member panel (or vice versa), in which case you and the registrant each pay half of the fee.

Fees start at $2,000 for single member and $4,500 for a 3-member panel.

### How much time might be involved?

In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the time from the opposing party being notified of your dispute submission to a decision being put in place may take up to 54 days but can be shorter.

The resolution provider will notify the domain name holder within 3 days of receiving your compliant application and the required payment. They will then be allowed up to 20 days to provide a response. Otherwise, the decision will be made based on the information you initially provided.

Once a response has been received or the deadline has passed, panel members will be appointed, and a decision will be made within 24 days which will be communicated to you, the other party and the provider of the disputed domain.

If the panel decides that the disputed domain name should be transferred or cancelled, the domain provider is required to wait 10 business days before fulfilling the decision.

* To have your submission accepted by the resolution provider, it needs to include the information set out in Paragraph 3 of Schedule B in the auDRP as well as any requirements detailed in the Provider's Supplemental Rules (available from the provider's website).

auDRP complaints must satisfy the following criteria for a successful outcome:

* You must own the rights to the trade mark or name.
* The .au domain name being contested is identical to the trade mark or confusingly similar.
* The .au registrant/domain name holder does not own any rights or have a legitimate interest in the domain name.
* The .au registrant has registered and used the domain name in bad faith.

### What is it?

Monitoring your supply chain involves establishing procedures to track goods and components from raw materials to delivery. It may include: 

* Vetting suppliers
* Implementing track‑and‑trace systems
* Analysing trade data to detect suspected copying or diversion of your products or intellectual property (IP)
* Regular inspections of incoming orders
* Sampling finished products for quality and authenticity
* Scanning online marketplace listings for unauthorised items
* Conducting basic factory or warehouse audits.

One aim of monitoring supply chains is to identify warning signs such as unusual shipping routes, surplus inventory or unregistered factories before counterfeit or unauthorised goods reach customers. Tools range from low‑cost verification and traceability solutions such as QR codes, RFID and barcode scans to supplier questionnaires and specialised software that tracks online marketplace listings.  

Some businesses may also engage third‑party brand‑protection services or share findings with local law enforcement. You can also alert the Australian Border Force to suspected trade mark or copyright infringing imports through the  [Notice of Objection](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/stop-infringing-goods-entering-country) scheme.  

Monitoring can be continuous or ad‑hoc and is most effective when paired with clear purchase agreements, auditing rights and staff training so everyone knows how to report suspected infringement.",,"Detect and discourage potential infringement in your supply chain

* Reduces risk of unsafe or non‑compliant items entering the market.
* Provides data and insight into infringement trends and behaviour.
* Can uncover new markets or trends in consumer demands.

### What might the costs be?

The costs for supply chain monitoring depend heavily on the extent of monitoring activities and whether you choose to engage third-party services such as commercial monitoring software or brand protection specialists. 

Costs for basic software subscriptions vary but can start in the low hundreds of dollars per year. Custom analytics or forensic audits may cost several thousand dollars. For more information on engaging third-party services, see [Obtain advice to help manage your IP.](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/obtain-legal-advice-help-manage-your-ip)

### How much time might be involved?

Implementing basic checks can be done in a shorter amount of time (days to weeks), depending on vendor and scope. Comprehensive programs covering supplier vetting, data integrations and response protocols may take several months to embed.  

Ongoing effort depends on shipment volume and review frequency, but it is common for businesses to implement some forms of supply chain monitoring.

### What is it?

Intellectual property (IP) refers to ideas or creations that can legally belong to a person in the form of a property right. Therefore, if you use someone else's IP without permission, the owner may claim infringement and try to stop you or seek compensation.  

Before you rely on using any IP, it helps to check who owns it. You can search the Australian patent, trade mark, design and PBR registers, or look for copyright notices that name the creator.  

If you can confirm the identity of the person or business who owns the IP, you may consider obtaining a permission to use it.  

Common approaches include a written licence, a distribution licence or buying the IP outright. Licences may be free, paid once, or ongoing; terms usually cover how, where and for how long you may use the IP. 

If you're unsure whether your planned use is legal, you may wish to speak with a qualified legal professional such as an IP lawyer or a trade mark or patent attorney. They can clarify whether an exception applies, such as the 'fair dealing' exceptions in copyright. These may allow limited use for things like research, study or review, depending on the context. 

**Please note:** Even accidental use can attract legal consequences. Written permission, clear records, and professional advice can reduce the chances of a costly dispute later.",,"Can I get in trouble for using IP that is not mine?

### What is it?

Scammers may pretend to be rights holders, lawyers or even government agencies to demand money, personal details, or business changes from innocent parties, or to deceive them into downloading malware onto your computer or other device. 

If you believe that the allegation of infringement from the other party is a scam or of a fraudulent nature, you could consider reporting scams or criminal behaviour to an appropriate authority. You can also consider consulting a legal professional such as a trade mark attorney, patent attorney or IP lawyer to assess the claims made by the other party and obtain legal advice. 

Common tactics used by scammers include emails or letters claiming your trade mark, business name,  domain name, content or product is infringing a registered trade mark, copyright or other IP rights. They might threaten to sue unless you pay a fee, or demand that you register your IP right using their services, often at an inflated cost. Note that there is no formal system of copyright registration in Australia - copyright automatically arises in original works and other subject-matter by virtue of the Copyright Act 1968, free of charge, as soon as you write down or otherwise record a work. 'Registering' your work with a private organisation would not give your material any greater copyright protection in Australia.

Scammers might also try to convince you to click on a link to a fake website to get access to your personal information or log-in credentials for a real platform you use, or to download malware by opening a file or link (for example, by saying this will let you see details of or dispute the alleged infringement, or dispute the supposed suspension of your account). You might also receive phone calls impersonating legal professionals or IP Australia officers. For more information on scams relating to IP rights, see IP Australia's page: [Scams related to managing IP rights](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/fraud-and-corruption/scams-related-to-managing-ip-rights). 

Several Australian federal and state bodies can help, depending on the situation: 

* The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), through its Scamwatch service.
* The Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD's ACSC).
* The Australian Federal Police (AFP) and state or territory police investigate fraud, impersonation, and criminal extortion.
* IP Australia.

Reporting fraudulent activity promptly can help protect others and build evidence for enforcement.

### What do you need to proceed?

If you believe that the other party is fraudulently claiming that you have infringed their IP, you could consider making a report to an appropriate authority.

**Scamwatch**

The ACCC collects scam reports to detect patterns and issue public alerts through its Scamwatch service. 

If your IP is being used as part of a scam or fraudulent activity (for example through email phishing activity), or if you have been the victim of a scam related to someone else's IP rights, you can report this activity to [Scamwatch](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/product-and-service-scams), using their [Report a Scam page](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam). 

**The Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD's ACSC)**

[Scams or fraudulent activities often take the form of cybercrimes](https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/where-get-help), using a computer or online network to target victims.

ReportCyber is the Australian Government's cybercrime reporting tool. They assess all cybercrime reports and assign the relevant ones to police and other law enforcement agencies for investigation. If you believe that the other party is using IP as part of fraudulent activity or criminal threats through digital channels such as emails, text messages, phone calls or social media, you can consider reporting this activity to Reportcyber using their[Report page](https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/report).   

**IP Australia**

IP Australia accepts reports of suspected misuse of its name or processes. You can read more about these on IP Australia's website at [Scams related to managing IP Rights | IP Australia.](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/fraud-and-corruption/scams-related-to-managing-ip-rights)  You can also learn how to report these at [How to report fraud and corruption | IP Australia.](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/fraud-and-corruption/how-to-report-fraud-and-corruption)  

**Federal and state police agencies**

The AFP and state or territory police investigate fraud, impersonation, and criminal extortion.

If you believe that the other party is involved in a serious cybercrime or a criminal fraud, you may also consider directly alerting the Australian Federal Police (AFP) or your State and Territory Police.",,"Report a scam, fraud or risk to public interest

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

Sometimes being accused of infringing someone else's intellectual property (IP) makes you aware of the other party's use of the contested IP for the first time. Looking into their allegations might lead you to suspect that it is actually you that has a stronger claim, and that it is your IP - not theirs - that is at risk of being infringed.  

It is quite common for both parties involved in an IP dispute to believe that their IP has been copied or misappropriated by the other side. Some common situations include: 

* The owner of a registered trade mark being accused of copying someone's unregistered trade mark or branding.
* Both parties believing that they are the rightful owner of contested IP. For instance, parties may have developed IP together but may have differing views as to who can own and use this IP, leading them to accuse each other of infringing the disputed IP.

If you think that someone accusing you of infringement is actually infringing *your*IP, you can consider whether to take enforcement action against them. 

There are a wide variety of enforcement actions with varying levels of formality, costs, benefits and risks, ranging from commercial, private pathways such as negotiation to something more formal, like court proceedings. Find out more about how to enforce your IP rights and compare different enforcement pathways by following the '[**I believe my IP has been infringed'**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement)option**.**  

Before taking any of these actions, it can be a good idea to consider whether the other party's actions amount to infringement -- see our information on [what infringement can look like](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/heres-some-helpful-information-enforcement). A legal professional can help you make this assessment and give advice on your next steps.",,"Assert your rights, as a response to an accusation

### What are the benefits?

The benefits of enforcing your own IP as a response to another infringement action will vary depending on the nature of the infringement and the strength of your IP. In general, some of the strengths of this action are: 

* It can help provide clarity about the respective strengths of your positions.
* Taking a proactive step may help you in later negotiations or mediations.
* It can help speed up the dispute if the other party is disingenuous.",,"Assert your rights, as a response to an accusation

### What are the risks?

The inherent risks of this action will vary depending on the nature of the infringement and the strength of your IP. In general, some of the risks of this action are: 

* Attempts to enforce a non-valid or non-relevant right can expose someone to legal issues such as unjustified threats (for more information, please see [Unjustified Threats](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/respond-unjustified-threat)).
* Trying to enforce a non-valid IP right will likely require a large investment without the possibility of a return.
* Attempting to enforce a right that is not valid will likely increase the damages levied against the losing party in a successful IP enforcement action.

Attempting to enforce your IP in response to an enforcement action can be a strategic decision, however you should **strongly consider**the relative strength and validity of the IP rights in question. You may wish to consider speaking to an IP lawyer or IP attorney before taking this course of action.",,"Assert your rights, as a response to an accusation

Trade mark infringement can occur when someone uses a brand name, logo, slogan, or another identifying mark that is too similar to someone else's registered trade mark,1 particularly if it is for the same or similar goods or services.2 This can lead to confusion among consumers about the source of the goods or services being offered.

In Australia, there are laws protecting registered trade marks (specifically the *Trade Marks Act 1995* (Cth)).

### What is protected under a registered trade mark?

Understanding what a registered trade mark protects is essential to identifying infringement.4 A trade mark registered with IP Australia gives its owner exclusive rights based on two key components:5

1. **The sign itself** - the word, logo, phrase, or other trade mark registered (see [Kinds of Trade Marks](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/what-are-trade-marks/kinds-of-trade-marks)  for more information).6
2. **The goods and services** - those listed in the registration (see  [Classes of Goods and Services](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/what-are-trade-marks/what-are-classes-of-goods-and-services)  for more information).7

Protection is generally limited to these combined elements.8 For example, a person will infringe a registered trade mark if they use a similar trade mark with the same or similar goods or services listed in the registration. In contrast, there may be no infringement if a similar sign is used for completely different goods or services.9

However, the law does protect well-known trade marks in some cases.10 Infringement can occur when a well-known trade mark is used in relation to goods or services unrelated to the registered trade mark.11",,"Trade mark infringement

### How does trade mark infringement happen?

Where a trade mark is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:

**1. Someone****uses** **a sign ""as a trade mark""**

This is a crucial requirement. The infringer must use the sign as a 'badge of origin,'12 or in other words, to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services.13 This involves using the trade mark to identify or differentiate their products or services in the marketplace.14 This requirement limits infringement and allows for legitimate references to trade marks in contexts that do not suggest commercial origin.

**Examples of use as a trade****mark****:**

* Applying the sign to product packaging or labels15
* Using the sign in advertising to promote goods or services16
* Displaying the sign on business signage or storefronts17
* Using the sign on websites to market products18

**Examples that are not use as a****trade** **mark:**

* Using a word in its ordinary descriptive sense (e.g., using ""apple"" to refer to the fruit)19
* Referring to a trade mark for informational purposes20
* Using a sign purely for functional or decorative purposes21

2. Someone uses an almost identical trade mark or one that is similar enough to confuse people

This is when someone uses a trade mark that resembles or sounds almost exactly like a registered trade mark,22 with only tiny differences that would go unnoticed by most consumers.

**For example,** suppose the word ""KOALA COMFORTS"" is a registered trade mark for bedding products. In that case, using ""KOALA KOMFORTS"" (just changing the spelling) for similar products would likely be considered too similar. Alternatively, someone uses a trade mark that, despite having some differences, is too similar to the registered trade mark. This similarity is likely to confuse consumers about who produces the product or provides the services.23 For instance, it may look or sound similar enough to a registered trade mark. 

**For example,** if ""BLUE WAVE"" with a wave picture is a registered trade mark for surfboards (see below), using ""BLU WAIVES"" with a similar wave design for surf gear could confuse customers into thinking they are from the same company.

![[image: stylised blue wave]](/sites/default/files/images/2025-07/Picture2.png)

When looking at possible trade mark infringement, courts compare the registered trade mark with the alleged infringing trade mark and consider:

* How similar the trade marks look and sound24
* The impression left by the trade marks25
* Whether the trade marks convey the same idea26
* Where and how the products are sold27
* Whether the typical customer would take the time to notice differences28
* Whether anyone has actually been confused.29

**3. Using the mark on the same or similar goods****or** **services**

Lastly, the trade mark is used to sell goods or services that are the same or similar to those listed in the registered trade mark. Therefore, infringement can still occur even when the trade mark is used for goods or services that are not identical to those covered by a registered trade mark but are similar or closely related.30

**For example,** if ""SUNNY DAYS"" is registered for coffee, using ""SUNNY DAYS"" for soft drinks might infringe because both products are related to non-alcoholic beverages.31 Customers might think the same company makes them.

Again, courts consider several factors when determining whether goods or services are similar or closely related.32

Alternatively, infringement can occur when someone uses a 'well known' trade mark in relation to goods or services unrelated to those listed in the registration.33 However, this kind of infringement has not been heard much in court, and its scope is not currently clear.",,"Trade mark infringement

### What is not trade mark infringement

It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The *Trade Marks Act 1995* provides several situations where a trade mark is not infringed, including a person who is:

* using their own name in good faith as a trade mark.34
* just describing the goods or services, or stating where your business is located.35
* indicating the intended purpose of the goods or services (like ""fits iPhone models"").36
* comparing the goods or services to others.37
* using an already registered trade mark.38
* using a trade mark that they could obtain registration for.39
* using a mark that they had before the other mark was registered.40
* re-selling or re-distributing goods that initially used the mark with the owner's permission (including parallel imports41",,"Trade mark infringement

### Understanding the boundaries of protection

It is essential to recognise that trade mark protection has limitations. Let's say, for example, you register ""SMARTBREW"" for coffee machines(listed under class 11) and coffee beans (listed under class 30). Potential infringement situations include:

1. **Clear infringement:** Another business begins selling coffee machines using the name ""SMARTBREW""
   * The alleged infringing mark is being used as a trade mark (it is on the machine and advertising).
   * The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" are identical.
   * The alleged infringing mark is being used for identical products (coffee machines).
2. **Possible infringement:** Another business starts selling coffee filters using ""STARTBREW"".
   * The business is using ""STARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging).
   * The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" look similar and sound similar. Consumers might be confused about where they came from.
   * The mark is being used on related but not identical goods. Courts would consider how similar these goods are.
3. **Unlikely to be infringement:** A company uses ""SMARTBREW"" for completely unrelated goods like gardening tools.
   * The business is using ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging).
   * The marks are identical, but the company uses the trade mark on goods that differ from the registered trade mark.
4. **Not infringement:** A coffee critique writes a review of the product entitled ""Is SmartBrew worth the money?""
   * The article's author is not using the word ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark.
5. **Not infringement:** Another company uses a different coffee-related name, like ""CLEVER COFFEE"", for coffee machines.
   * The business is using ""CLEVER COFFEE"" as a trade mark.
   * However, ""CLEVER COFFEE"" and the registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" are too dissimilar.

Navigating trade mark infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Additionally, the registered trade mark must be legally valid. A registered trade mark may be challenged in court and sought to be cancelled during a claim of infringement. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

You can request an examination to certify your design when you file, or at any time during the registration period. A certified design gives you the legal right to take action against others who use it without permission. If you request certification, one of IP Australia's examiner~~'~~s will complete a full examination to check whether your design is new and distinctive. If your design passes the examination, IP Australia will issue you a certificate, and your design will then be 'certified'. 

Examination is often requested by the design's owner to secure full protection of their registered design. Examination can also be requested by a third party ahead of a dispute, usually where the third party wants to test the validity of a registered design. 

If an issue is raised during the examination process, you will have the chance to respond to the issues outlined in the report. You may be able to address these issues by providing submissions or other evidence in response to the assessment, amending the registration or requesting a hearing.  

**You can only take formal action to protect your design right -- like sending a letter of demand (or cease-and-desist letter) -- after your design is certified. A threat to start infringement or similar proceedings against another person in respect of a design will be an unjustified threat if the design has not been certified. A person who receives such a threat can start legal action against the person making the threat. For more information, please see** [**Unjustified Threats**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/respond-unjustified-threat).",,"Request IP Australia confirms a registered design is valid

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

Parties involved in an IP dispute can negotiate a mutually acceptable commercial or financial agreement to resolve their dispute. While negotiation between parties often takes place as a preventative measure prior to launching a more formal action, it can also be used at any stage during a dispute process.   

Parties can propose and negotiate commercial outcomes in different ways, including communicating directly in person or through correspondence, or instructing their lawyers to communicate on their behalf.   

Negotiation for a commercial outcome is particularly suitable if you and the other party are involved:   

* can have a discussion and make decisions without relying on formal procedures
* want to maintain ongoing relationship with the other parties involved
* want to find productive ways to resolve the dispute, which can benefit all parties involved
* would like to maintain control over the outcome, rather than having someone hand down a decision
* want to keep discussions confidential (if the parties involved agree that the negotiations will be confidential).

In deciding whether negotiation is a suitable pathway, you can consider:  

* whether you can identify and contact the other parties involved
* the other parties' willingness to participate in negotiations
* when and where negotiation will take place
* how decisions will be made and observed
* each party's desires, needs and priorities in relation to the disputed issues
* whether you will negotiate directly with the other party or whether you will be assisted by representatives or support people
* what outcomes would benefit each of the parties involved
* your next steps if the negotiation does not yield an agreement.

Sometimes, direct negotiation may not be the best way forward to resolve an IP dispute. This is especially the case if you have a difficult relationship with the other parties involved or find it challenging to communicate with the other parties. For this reason, representatives such as lawyers are commonly used.  

In some cases, having a neutral third party such as a mediator may help you overcome these challenges and facilitate an outcome, as opposed to direct negotiation (see - [Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/mediation)).

* Flexible and informal, as it is entirely up to the parties to shape the process
* Parties can focus on the issues that matter to both sides.
* Negotiation can be conducted across multiple jurisdictions.
* Parties can agree to keep the negotiations confidential.

* Relies on genuine engagement and willingness of parties to resolve issues.
* If you do not agree to enter into a legally binding agreement that sets out the agreed outcomes from the negotiations, it may be difficult to enforce the outcomes. This risk can be avoided if you enter into a legally binding agreement.
* If you do not negotiate in good faith with the other parties, this may prompt them to escalate and resist, rather than comply.
* Depending on what you say to the other parties, or what you might agree with them, this could impact your ability to take other enforcement action in future. **It is usually prudent to tell the other parties that any negotiations are on a 'without prejudice' basis and to include this in any written communications with them.**",,"Agree to a formal commercial arrangement

### What are the possible outcomes?

Commercial negotiations can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the parties' desires and specific circumstances. Some popular forms of commercial arrangements involving IP include:   

**Licensing** 

You can agree to a licensing agreement. Licensing involves the owner of the IP or someone else with a right to licence the IP (the licensor) giving someone else (the licensee) permission to use - but not own - their IP usually in exchange for payment. For detailed information on types of licences and licence conditions, see [How To Licence My IP | IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/how-to-commercialise-my-ip/how-to-licence-my-ip#:~:text=Licensing%20involves%20the%20owner%20of,IP%20in%20exchange%20for%20payment.).  

**Assignment (selling or transferring your IP)** 

You may decide to sell your IP as part of your negotiation with the other party. This involves transferring the ownership of the IP to another entity (the assignee) through a process called 'assignment' so that you no longer have the rights to use the IP.  

Once assignment is completed, you won't have any control over the IP asset you have sold unless you have agreed that the assignee licence some rights back to you. The assignee will bear the risk of commercial development of the IP and be responsible for all costs, including renewal fees paid to IP Australia.   

Once the title of a registered IP right has been assigned through a contractual agreement, the transfer of the ownership can be recorded on the IP Australia register through IP Australia's[Online Services portal](https://portal.ipaustralia.gov.au/login?_gl=1%2an6kr9w%2a_ga%2aMTUwOTM4MDc5LjE3MzM3ODMxNTI.%2a_ga_GMT4KC15KS%2aMTczOTIyMTY0Ny41NS4xLjE3MzkyMjU5MTEuMC4wLjA.).  

**Franchising (trade marks)** 

In a franchise agreement, you can give one or more parties (the franchisees) the right to use your trade mark or trade name, your business systems and processes, and so on.  

The licensed rights are typically used by the franchisees to provide goods or services to agreed specifications. In return, they pay royalties and fees. Franchisees often contribute to marketing costs for the brand as well. Franchising is a highly regulated area of law and you should consult with a franchising expert such as a franchising lawyer before agreeing to a franchising agreement. 

**Letter of consent or co-existence agreement (trade marks)** 

Trade mark owners can negotiate to have their trade marks co-exist in the market. This can allow both parties to use potentially conflicting rights in ways that both agree to (such as in certain geographical areas).  

Trade mark co-existence agreements may take the form a formal contract stipulating rights and obligations of both parties, or a letter of consent where a party gives the other party (often in the form of[a letter](https://manuals.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademark/annex-a1---an-example-of-a-letter-of-consent) ) consent to the registration of their right with IP Australia.",,"Agree to a formal commercial arrangement

### How much time might be involved?

Commercial negotiation often serves as a cost-effective and non-adversarial way to resolve a dispute with the other party.   

However, the amount of time taken to reach an agreeable outcome with the other party will vary depending on the complexity of each case, individual circumstances surrounding each party, and whether the parties choose to engage an IP professional to act on your behalf.",,"Agree to a formal commercial arrangement

### What do you need to proceed?

It's important to get all the factual details right and evaluate the merits of your claims before you reach out to the other party. Here are some things you might want to check and consider before talking to the other party:  

* The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where the alleged infringement/dispute occurred. This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the alleged infringer has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices.
* Ensuring your claims do not amount to baseless accusations which would be seen as unjustified threats.
* The identity and contact details of the other party - it's important to make sure you speak to the correct party.

Throughout the negotiation with the other party, it can be helpful to remember to:  

* Make sure you stay calm and professional throughout the conversation, avoiding emotional, accusatory language.
* Focus on the issues at hand, not the personalities of the other parties involved.
* Acknowledge that problems are often caused by misunderstanding or oversight, and that a mutually beneficial outcome can often be reached.
* Be clear on the terms of agreement you reached with the other party, writing down the agreement in detail at the end of the conversation and making sure you enter into a legally binding agreement that reflects the negotiated outcome. An IP lawyer can assist you with negotiations or recording the outcomes in a legally binding agreement.

It can be difficult to determine whether negotiations are a suitable option. An IP professional can help you make this assessment and advise what steps would work best in your situation.",,"Agree to a formal commercial arrangement

### Exercise caution before making accusations of infringement

Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation or damages or an order that you stop making the threat. Proving infringement is an important issue that should be considered before taking entering into negotiations.

### What is it?

If you are unhappy with how a lawyer or a patent or trade marks attorney has acted, you may be able to make a formal complaint to the body that regulates them. This process is meant to protect the public, keep professional standards high, and deal with serious misconduct. 

For lawyers, complaints are handled by the relevant regulator in each state and territory. They can look into both service issues (such as poor communication or delays) and conduct issues (such as dishonesty or serious breaches of professional rules). 

For registered patent and trade marks attorneys, complaints go to the **Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board** (TTIPAB). This Board makes sure attorneys follow their Code of Conduct, which requires them to act lawfully, in the best interests of clients and in the public interest. 

Before making a formal complaint, it is often worth trying to resolve the problem directly with the lawyer or attorney, or someone more senior in their firm. Many issues can be addressed through clearer communication or by following the firm's own complaint process. 

To issue a complaint you will usually need to provide: 

* Your name and contact details.
* The name of the lawyer or attorney.
* A clear description of what happened and when.
* Copies of relevant documents, emails, or agreements.

There are often **time limits**. Many regulators will not investigate matters that happened more than three years ago, unless there are special circumstances or it is in the public interest. 

After you lodge a complaint, the regulator may: 

* Dismiss it if there is not enough evidence or it is outside their scope.
* Offer mediation to help both sides reach agreement.
* Investigate to decide if professional rules were broken.

**Please note:** Regulators usually cannot order a lawyer or attorney to pay you compensation. If you want compensation, you may need to look at other dispute resolution processes or court action.",,"How can I make a complaint about a lawyer or attorney?

### What is it?

Third Party Notification of Prior Art lets you raise concerns about someone else's patent application directly with IP Australia *before* it's accepted or granted. You do this by lodging a 'section 27 notice', which alerts the examiner to earlier work - known as 'prior art' - that may show the application lacks novelty or inventiveness. 

*Section 27 notices* are allowed up to three months after the *notice of* acceptance of an application. Formal opposition becomes available after the patent is *accepted*, and court or administrative action may be possible after the grant of the patent. 

You can raise the same kinds of concerns about a patent at different points in its life - but the mechanism you use depends on the patent's current status. 

Raising concerns during examination can be quicker, simpler and less costly. It gives the examiner a chance to consider your evidence before a decision is made. If successful, this could prevent a patent from being granted at all--avoiding future disputes. 

You don't need to own a patent or be directly affected to file a notice. Anyone can use this option if they have access to useful prior art and act within the time window. 

This is a one-way process: the examiner considers your materials, but you won't be told the outcome, and you can't argue your case. There are still other channels in which you can pursue the matter if the patent is accepted despite the S27 submissions. 

It is also important to consider that the document(s) raised under the s27(1) notice were published prior to the relevant priority date of the patent application.",,"Prevent a patent under examination from being granted

### What is it?

Applying for a patent is one way to protect a new product, process or method that you've developed. 

A patent application is a formal request to IP Australia to be granted exclusive rights over your invention. If granted, a patent can stop others from making, using, or selling your invention in Australia without your permission. 

Patents are typically used for inventions that are new, useful and involve an inventive step. This could include anything from a physical product to a chemical process, mechanical tool or software-enabled system. 

You don't need a granted patent to start selling your product, but a patent can strengthen your legal position and give you more control over how your invention is used by others. 

It is important to note that disclosing your invention can create issues later on for your patent application - if you are considering applying for a patent, it is important to avoid publicly disclosing your invention. 

You can apply for a standard patent or a provisional application first--each has different costs, benefits and timeframes. Provisional applications are often used as a first step to secure a priority date while you refine your invention or seek investors. 

A provisional application does not offer any patent protection, and simply acts as a placeholder while you decide whether to continue with the patenting process. A provisional application gives you 12 months to consider your options, and most importantly, it establishes your priority date.  

If you wish to proceed with the application process (and enter the examination stage), you will need to file a standard application. Importantly, you can use the priority date from your provisional application in your standard application. This is of particular value if there is a competitor who has filed a patent application - if they are both directed towards a similar process, you would have a greater chance of being granted the patent owing to your earlier priority date.  

It is important to note that any features claimed in your standard application must have also been disclosed in your provisional application if you wish to claim the earlier priority date.",,"Apply for a patent to protect your invention from being copied

### What might the costs be?

Patent costs vary depending on the type of application and whether you use professional support. 

* **Provisional patent application**: From around $110 if self-filed with IP Australia (as discussed above, a provisional application does not offer any patent protection, and simply acts as a placeholder while you consider your options).
* **Standard patent application**: Filing starts at $400, with potential additional costs for examination, maintenance and legal advice.
* **Patent attorney fees**: May range from $2,000 to over $10,000 depending on complexity.
* **Ongoing fees**: Annual renewal fees start at $300 at the 4th anniversary and steadily increase to $2815 for the 19th anniversary (i.e. for the 20th year).

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

Online platforms such as e-commerce platforms, social media sites and digital advertising providers provide an excellent mechanism to promote and sell your products to consumers around the world. However, a lot of infringing and counterfeiting activities occur in this space as well, which can undermine legitimate brands and damage their reputation. This can also include selling, reproducing or making available copies of material that is subject to copyright. The 'intermediaries' have a responsibility not to facilitate infringement.    

If you notice infringement on a website or online platform, you can approach the owners of the site to request that they take down infringing content. To find out who owns a website, you can check their domain name's registration in the [Australian](https://www.auda.org.au/au-domain-names/domain-name-help/using-whois)  and [international WHOIS databases](https://lookup.icann.org/en). 

Most e-commerce platforms and major digital advertisers/search engine providers have a notice and take-down mechanism for handling IP complaints, including those concerning counterfeit goods and material that infringes copyright. 

You can be proactive by listing your IP rights with different e-commerce platforms before anyone tries to sell counterfeit goods. Some platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, invite you to add your trade marks and other kinds of IP rights to a brand registry. This is used in automated checks to detect infringing goods before they are even listed for sale. 

**Note:** It can be time-consuming for rights owners to monitor e-commerce platforms and submit IP complaints themselves. A time and cost-effective way to manage this process is often to engage IP professionals such as IP monitoring services. These IP professionals can use their experience and knowledge to identify and remove counterfeit goods across multiple online platforms.Beyond online marketplaces, many other digital platforms available to Australian users (including social media platforms to which users can upload content) also offer mechanisms that copyright owners can use to address or prevent infringement. These often include complaint forms and notice and takedown processes that copyright owners can use if they believe their rights have been infringed. They may also include bespoke tools copyright owners can choose use to proactively manage and enforce their rights on those platforms. For example,  automated content recognition/identification or screening tools (like YouTube Content ID or Meta Rights Manager) allow copyright owners to upload their content and find matches to content uploaded on platforms by third parties. Where matches are found, copyright owners may be able to seek to pre-emptively block or otherwise monetise the content (for example, through share of advertising revenue in some cases).

### What are the benefits?

* Cost-effective.
* Often quick to action and obtain outcome.
* Simple to prepare and initiate compared to other enforcement options.
* Outcome-focused, as it targets infringing products/content directly and prevents customers making purchases/accessing the infringing content.
* Some platforms are not limited by the country the infringer is located in, due to these platforms having an international reach - while others only action takedown requests within jurisdictions in which the rights apply.
* You may not need to identify or track down the infringer yourself.
* Being able to reduce infringement and prevent sales being diverted by addressing infringement on a major sales channel.",,"Notify online marketplaces of infringement on their platform

### What do you need to proceed?

If you have detected infringement on an online platform, it is worth checking several platforms (such as all those listed above) to see if infringement is taking place elsewhere. 

Different online platforms have different requirements for making IP complaints and takedown requests. 

You will usually need: 

* Evidence such as screenshots, product listings, and any other documentation that clearly demonstrates the infringement. Refer to [Evidence you can collect about infringements](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/heres-some-helpful-information-enforcement).
* Evidence that you are the legitimate owner of the IP. Some platforms require you to have a registered IP right for you to access their brand protection and complaint mechanisms. You may consider applying for a registered IP right to access these procedures and prevent future infringements and protect your ideas, products and branding.

Note that if you do not provide sufficiently accurate information, your takedown application may be rejected and the whole process would be delayed. 

For matters involving copyright infringement online, before issuing a takedown notice, copyright owners should check that the user does not have a valid reason to use the material in question (for example a valid license or a 'fair dealing' use permitted as an exception to copyright under the Copyright Act). More information about when using copyright material is allowed is provided on the [copyright infringement page](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/copyright-infringement).",,"Notify online marketplaces of infringement on their platform

### Exercise caution before making accusations of infringement

Making an unfounded claim of IP infringement can result in liability for damages. Proving infringement is an important issue that should be considered before taking legal action, including sending written demands. 

*Before you take any action, you should consider whether you need legal or professional advice specific to your situation. It is important to know what rights you have, what remedies are open to you, and the cost and likelihood of success.

### What is it?

The [WIPO Clause Generator](https://amc.wipo.int/clause-generator/)  is a free online tool developed by the World Intellectual Property Organization Arbitration and Mediation Centre ([WIPO AMC)](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/). It helps you draft contract clauses that refer intellectual property (IP) disputes to WIPO's dispute resolution services - particularly useful for agreements involving overseas partners or cross-border transactions. The model Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) clauses contain the principal elements of a clause to avoid any ambiguity that may later complicate and delay the dispute resolution of a dispute. 

There are a range of provisions and clauses which can be included in contracts relevant to your situation, which may not be covered by the WIPO Clause Generator. A legal professional can help tailor contacts to reflect your business, the jurisdiction, as well as your preferred resolution options. 

The WIPO Clause Generator covers common forms of (ADR) offered by WIPO, such as mediation, arbitration, expedited arbitration, and expert determination. These options are often built into commercial contracts to help avoid costly and time-consuming court action. The tool also guides you through standard clause elements - like naming a mediator or arbitrator, identifying their qualifications, setting a preferred location and language, and agreeing how long to wait before escalating to the next step. 

The generator works for both future contracts (using *model clauses*, which set out in advance how any disputes will be handled) and current disputes (using *submission agreements*, which allow both parties to agree - after a dispute has already begun - to use WIPO to resolve it). Using the tool may also serve as a prompt for parties to discuss and align their dispute preferences early, creating a clearer path forward if things go wrong later. 

[WIPO](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html)  is recognised globally as the leading body for resolving IP disputes, and their recommended clauses reflect global standard-practice. The tool is a helpful way to plan how IP disagreements could be handled, especially in international business settings - though it should not be mistaken for tailored legal advice.",,"Plan how IP disputes will be handled via contracts

### What are the benefits?

* The *WIPO AMC* is specialised in IP and technology disputes and offers time and cost efficient ADR options.
* Helps you clearly set out in your contract how international IP disputes will be managed through confidential and neutral dispute resolution processes such as mediation or arbitration.
* Helps you explore widely recognised ADR options -- including mediation, arbitration, expedited arbitration and expert determination -- and guides you through common decisions often built into contracts. These include choosing the type of process, naming a mediator or arbitrator, setting expectations around their qualifications or expertise, agreeing on the location and language of proceedings, online conduct of proceedings, and specifying how long to wait before escalating to the next step.

* You may be less able to seek resolution within Australia if you commit to international resolution processes, or
* You may wave certain rights such as the ability to appeal a decision after arbitration.
* Contact clauses may not suit all situations - particularly if your dispute requires court enforcement or urgent remedies.

### What is it?

Searching through the publicly accessible list of registered designs helps you understand whether your product infringes upon an existing registered design. This is sometimes called a clearance search or a freedom to operate search (FTO).

These searches look across the Australian Design Search database to identify any earlier registered designs that may limit your ability to make, sell or import your design. 

You can carry out a search yourself using [Australian Design Search](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/designs/search/quick)  on the IP Australia website for registered designs in Australia. Should you wish to export your product overseas, many overseas IP offices also offer free search tools for registered designs in their jurisdictions. Searching and interpreting existing designs can be complex, so you may want to reach out to an IP professional with experience in designs to run such searches or help interpret any results.

While not a guarantee against disputes, a freedom to operate search can reduce the chance of running into legal and commercial conflicts in the future.

**Determining if two designs are similar can be difficult without IP knowledge. You may wish to seek professional assistance from an IP attorney or other service which offers designs searches.

### What is protected by copyright?

Copyright protects original creative works without requiring registration.1 In Australia, copyright protection generally lasts for 70 years after the author's death. Protection is automatic once the work is created and documented.2 Additionally, there is no need to use the © symbol next to the protected work. 

Copyright provides legal protection for people who express their ideas in an original way.3 Ideas alone cannot be protected under copyright law.4 

Copyright protects several types of creative works, including: 

* Literary works (like books, articles, computer programs, software code, song lyrics and poems).5
* Artistic works (like paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, maps, diagrams and works of artistic craftsmanship).6
* Musical works(musical compositions or the notes and arrangement).7
* Dramatic works (like plays, scripts, dance choreography, mime performances).8

Copyright also protects creations of other technologies, including: 

* Sound recordings.9
* Films.10
* Television and radio broadcasts.11
* Published editions (that is, the typographical arrangement in a book).12

The duration of copyright protection can vary depending on the type of copyrighted material. 

Importantly, copyright material created overseas can be protected in Australia. Suppose the material is made by someone in a country that is a party to a relevant international copyright convention to which Australia is also a party. In that case, it will also be protected in Australia.13",,"Copyright infringement

### What rights do copyright owners have?

Copyright law grants the owner the right to control how their work is used. These rights vary depending on the type of work, but generally include: 

* **Reproduction:** Making copies of the work.14
* **Publication:** Making the work publicly available for the first time.15
* **Public performance:** Performing the work in public.16
* **Communication to the public:** Transmitting the work electronically (e.g., online).17
* **Adaptation:** Creating adaptations, such as translations or screen adaptations.18

For sound recordings, films, and broadcasts, the rights include making copies, playing them in public, and communicating them to the public.19",,"Copyright infringement

### When does copyright infringement occur?

Australian copyright law grants authors and creators exclusive control over their material.20 Generally, copyright is infringed if a person performs one of the exclusive acts reserved to the copyright owner without the copyright owner's permission, and an exception or limitation does not apply. 21 

Depending on how the copyright material was used, the following requirements need to be proven to establish infringement.  

**1. Someone reproduces the copyright work**

Reproduction involves some form of copying. To establish infringement, three key elements must be shown: 

1. **The whole or a ""substantial"" part of the copyright-protected work has been used.** Infringement can occur even if a part of it was copied. ""Substantial"" refers to quality rather than quantity. Even a small but important or distinctive part may be substantial. Courts will look at the entirety of the original copyright work and consider whether the quality or essential part of the work was copied.22
2. **There is a connection between the copyright-protected work and the copied work.** Infringement will generally be found if there was access to the copyright work.23 Independent creation is unlikely to be an infringement.24
3. **There is an objective similarity between the original copyright-protected work and the copied work.** Courts compare the works to determine if there is an objective similarity. Literal copying is straightforward, but courts may struggle if the similarities are not apparent.25

Copyright law will automatically consider copying to occur when a literary, dramatic or musical work has been made into a sound recording or film26 or converted into digital form.27 Additionally, an artistic work in two-dimensional form will be infringed if it has been made into three dimensions and vice versa.28 

**2. Someone publishes the work**

Infringement will occur when someone makes something available to the public in Australia that was not previously available.29 

**3. Someone performs the work in public**

Infringement will happen when someone performs the work for members of the public.  

**4. Someone communicates the work to the public**

Infringement will occur if someone makes the work available to the public by uploading it to the Internet, for example.30 

**5. Someone copies a sound recording, film or broadcast**

Infringement occurs when someone makes a copy of a sound recording or film and plays or shows it in public.31",,"Copyright infringement

### Common misconceptions about copyright infringement

**""I changed it by 10%, so it's not infringement.""** There is no percentage rule. Even small portions can infringe if they are an important or distinctive part of the original work. 

**""I gave credit to the creator.""** Attribution does not prevent infringement.  

**""It was only for personal use.""** Personal use is not a general exception to copyright infringement in Australia, though specific exceptions may apply. 

**""I found it online, so it's free to use.""** Works found online are still protected by copyright law unless it is in the public domain or under an open licence.",,"Copyright infringement

### When is using copyright material allowed?

It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. Notably, when copyright protection expires, the material enters what is known as the ""public domain."" These works can be freely used. 

The Copyright Act also provides numerous defences and exceptions that enable some use of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner in certain circumstances. These exceptions permit ""fair dealings"" with copyright material for particular purposes, including: 

* research or study32
* criticism or review33
* reporting of news34
* giving of professional legal advice35
* parody and satire36
* making accessible format copies by, or on behalf of, a person with a disability.37

Determining copyright infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Experts can help work out exactly what is protected by copyright and how it has been copied. Additionally, they can assess the available defences and exceptions under the Copyright Act that can affect the outcome. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

### What is it?

Registration of a trade mark can be 'revoked' in certain circumstances where it should not have been registered in the first place. This is only possible within the first 12 months of registration. 

Generally, revocation of registration is followed immediately by revocation of acceptance, resulting in the subject trade mark application returning to the examiner for a re-examination. Only in very rare cases would a revocation of registration return to the 'Accepted' status, allowing an opposition to proceed instead of a re-examination by a trade mark examiner.  

Revocation of registration is rare. It is not a substitute for court action to challenge someone else's entitlement to a trade mark, rather, it is about identifying information showing that the registration should not have occurred in the first place. The power to revoke will usually only be used where there is a clear case: 

* of error by IP Australia, or
* new circumstances become known.

The Registrar of Trade Marks (the Registrar) is not required to consider a request for revocation, but if they do, they must consider all the circumstances and whether it is reasonable to revoke the registration, including whether there is a more appropriate remedy (such as court challenge). 

In making a revocation decision, IP Australia can take account of a range of circumstances that could have prevented registration. This includes reasons which go to the heart of whether the application should have been accepted, such as whether it's:  

* scandalous
* likely to cause confusion
* not sufficiently distinctive
* too similar to another registered trade mark.

### What are the benefits?

* There is no cost involved in giving this information to IP Australia.
* Revocation procedures are generally run internally within IP Australia, meaning that you are less likely to confront other parties, compared to more adversarial ways of dispute resolution (i.e. court proceedings, administrative hearing procedures, etc.).",,"Remove a trade mark from the register

### What are the risks?

* IP Australia does not have an obligation to consider a request to revoke a trade mark registration. As such, it might be risky to base your entire enforcement strategy on this procedure expecting IP Australia to make a revocation decision, instead of using other enforcement mechanisms such as challenging the trade mark registration through the court system.
* While IP Australia does not publish the details of the party who requested revocation, it is possible for documents to be obtained under Freedom of Information Act 1982 so the owner of the trade mark can ascertain the identity of the party who requested revocation.
* This procedure provides a much more limited opportunity to participate in the decision-making process, when compared to challenging a trade mark registration through the opposition and hearing procedures or courts.
* Even if revocation of acceptance follows revocation of registration, the application will be returned to examination and the owner of the application will be given 15 months to overcome the grounds for rejection preventing their application from achieving acceptance.
* In some rare cases, the application may only be reverted to acceptance stage even though the registration has been revoked, meaning that opposition process would need to be initiated to block the application proceeding to registration once more. You might need to undertake an opposition in order to prevent registration occurring again.",,"Remove a trade mark from the register

* Upon receipt of information, IP Australia may initiate the procedure to revoke the registered trade mark.
* Revocation procedure is not initiated despite the information provided. As noted above, IP Australia does not have an obligation to consider a request to revoke a trade mark registration.
* Once the revocation procedure is initiated, IP Australia must give the owner of the registered trade mark the opportunity to be heard on the revocation (to put their case forward why it shouldn't be revoked). If they are successful, the registration will be maintained. If they are unsuccessful, the registration can be revoked.
* If a decision is made to revoke registration, the owner of the registered trade mark is able to appeal this decision to the courts. If they are successful, the registration will be maintained. If they are unsuccessful, the registration can be revoked.",,"Remove a trade mark from the register

### What is it?

If someone has accused you of copying or using their trade mark without permission, and the other party's trade mark is pending registration with IP Australia,  you may be able to challenge their trade mark application directly with IP Australia by initiating a trade mark opposition process. This process requires you to submit your supporting evidence and argument as to why the trade mark should not be registered.

There are several reasons on which a trade mark application can be opposed, including (but not limited to):

* Similarity to an existing trade mark
* Being too generic or descriptive
* Containing a connotation that is misleading and confusing.

If your actions are successful, the  other party will no longer have rights associated with the registration of their trade mark.

Objections to the registration of a trade mark can typically only be raised within 2 months of its acceptance date being published. If this period has passed, you may need to explore other options.

If the application you wish to oppose is in the two-month window, you can file a 'Notice of Intention to Oppose'  before it becomes registered. The opposition procedure can involve either a written or oral hearing, or a written decision without a hearing.",,"Challenge the registration of a new trade mark to defend your right

### What are the benefits?

* A successful opposition weakens the other party's rights to the trade mark that is allegedly being copied or used without permission.
* Trade mark opposition and hearing processes are more informal and generally quicker than court proceedings in reaching an outcome.
* Hearing officers in IP Australia have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.
* The process is accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.
* The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.
* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.",,"Challenge the registration of a new trade mark to defend your right

### What are the risks?

* If your opposition is unsuccessful and the trade mark proceeds to registration, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.
* When opposing the registration of a trade mark, the applicant will be notified of your opposition. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the other party be aware of your actions.
* Due to the public nature of these procedures there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to take an enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy.
* There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.
* Using these procedures improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.
* If you are successful in opposing registration of a trade mark, the denied applicant may appeal the decision to court.
* If you lose, the other party may refer to that decision in their infringement claim, though Courts are not bound by IP Australia's decisions.
* The other party may still take court action during the process.",,"Challenge the registration of a new trade mark to defend your right

### What are the possible outcomes?

* IP Australia refuses the application and the trade mark does become registered.
* The applicant narrows or amends the goods and services specified in the trade mark application, and it proceeds in a reduced form.
* The opposition to registering the trade mark is dismissed and the trade mark is registered without changes.
* Either party appeals a decision to the Administrative Review Tribunal, or the Federal Court of Australia, or the Federal Circuit and Family Court.

### What is it?

An intellectual property (IP) audit is a review of the intellectual property you or your business owns, uses or has acquired. It aims to identify what IP exists in your portfolio, who owns it, what it's worth, its legal status, and what to do next. An IP audit is often the very first step in designing and setting up a [comprehensive IP strategy](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/develop-strategy-manage-your-ip). 

Audits can be done in-house or with help from IP professionals such as IP lawyers or a qualified patent or trade mark attorney. They offer a clear picture of whether your IP assets are protected and aligned with your business goals. 

Common triggers for an IP audit include: 

* Significant corporate change, such as a merger or acquisition
* Entering a joint venture or strategic alliance
* Transfer or assignment of IP rights
* Launch of a new product line or market expansion
* Initiation of enforcement or defence actions.

However, many businesses also conduct regular audits to systematically review their IP portfolio to evaluate their IP assets, renew their IP rights and minimise risks.",,"CONDUCT IP AUDITS TO SPOT GAPS, REDUCE RISKS AND PLAN NEXT STEPS

### What is it?

A *patent opposition* is when someone formally challenges the grant of your patent through IP Australia, after it has been accepted or amended. If someone opposes your patent application in this way, you'll have a chance to respond through IP Australia's formal hearing process. The hearing process is administrative, not a court proceeding, but the outcome can still have serious impacts on your rights. 

The oppositions process allows both sides to put forward written arguments and evidence to support their position; arguing that the patent should or should not be granted. If the issue isn't resolved between the parties at this stage, a Delegate of the Commissioner of Patents will review everything and make a final decision. 

You can ask for an oral hearing or conduct the process entirely in writing. Either way, this is your opportunity to defend your patent and explain why it meets the legal requirements to be granted.",,"Respond to an opposition filed against your patent

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

Monitoring competitors' trade marks involves regularly checking the Australian Trade Marks Register, your market and other sources to spot new or changing brands that may be too similar to yours. 

Early detection can give you time to oppose an application, contact the other business, or adjust your own plans before investing further.  

You can do this yourself using search engines and free tools such as [IP Australia's Australian Trade mark Search (ATMS)](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/quick)  and its 'saved search' features, or pay a commercial service to send you regular reports.  

You can also be flexible with the scope of your monitoring activity - you decide how often to check, which classes of goods and services or markets to watch, and whether to include overseas registers.",,"Monitor the trade mark register and market for competitor activity

### What are the benefits?

* There is a higher chance of detecting potential conflicts early, before it escalates into a serious dispute or products reach shelves.
* Gives you more time to gather evidence and consider responses such as [informal contact](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/provide-opportunity-stop-infringement) or [trade mark opposition](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/challenge-registration-trade-mark).

### What might the costs be?

Monitoring the register on IP Australia's Australian Trade Marks Search (ATMS) is free apart from your time. Many overseas national IP offices also offer free search tools. You can also monitor the market by regularly conducting searches on internet search engines or e-commerce platforms. 

Commercial monitoring services typically start from a few hundred dollars per year for one class of goods and services claimed and rise with extra classes or overseas coverage.

### How much time might be involved?

The time involved will depend heavily on the scope of your monitoring activities, such as whether you are including overseas trade mark registers, the number of e-commerce platforms or how many classes of goods and services you would like to cover. A quick manual check can take minutes, but reviewing saved searches may become a short weekly task. 

Using a watch service is quicker day-to-day, yet you still need time to review results and decide on any follow-up.

### What are Plant Breeder's Rights?

PBRs protect new plant varieties.2 In Australia, when someone registers a plant variety, they obtain exclusive rights to control how that plant's reproductive materials (such as seeds, cuttings, or bulbs) are used and sold. If another person uses the plant variety without proper permission, they may be infringing the owner's rights.

**For example,** the barley variety Spartacus CL or the flowering plant variety called LegacyFlame. 

While a PBR is granted for a particular new variety of plants and their propagating material (such as seeds or stems), in some cases, breeders can claim further protection. Protection can extend to:

* Harvested material.3
* Products of harvested material.4
* Plant varieties that could only be developed from a PBR-protected variety (known as dependent varieties and essentially derived varieties).5
* Propagating material of dependent varieties and essentially derived varieties.6",,"Plant breeder's rights (PBR) infringement

Infringement of Plant Breeders' Rights (PBRs) can occur when someone uses a protected variety without the owner's permission. In Australia, PBRs last for up to 20 years or 25 years, depending on the plant type.
### How does PBR infringement happen?

Where a PBR is registered with IP Australia, the following activities may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without permission of the owner:

**1. Someone uses the plant variety**

Australian plant variety law gives plant breeders exclusive control over their varieties.7 Infringement occurs when a person uses a protected plant variety in ways that only the owner is allowed to do so and without permission.8 They could be using the plant variety in different ways, including:

* **Producing or reproducing the plant material.** This happens when someone creates more plants of the protected variety. Reproduction here is the act of making more plants by growing seeds or using cuttings.9
* **Conditioning the plant material for propagation.** This happens when someone prepares the plant materials for growing more plants.10 For example, cleaning, coating, sorting, packaging, or grading materials such as seeds, stems, and branches.
* **Commercialising of propagating material.** Including selling (or offering to sell) plants or their reproductive materials, bringing protected plant materials into Australia or sending them overseas or keeping plant materials for any of these commercial purposes.11

**2. Someone uses the plant variety name**

Infringement can also occur where the protected plant variety name is used on other plants or varieties.12 Protection can extend to include a synonym of the plant variety name registered with IP Australia.13

**For example,** if a plant breeder registers a new rose variety with the name 'SUNSPARK' with the synonym 'SPARK', another grower developing and selling a rose called 'SPARK' would be an infringement.

**3. Someone uses an****essentially derived variety**

PBR protection also covers plant varieties that are very similar to the protected ones.14 Therefore, infringement can occur when someone uses another variety that is considered too similar. Owners of PBRs can also seek to have  varieties called an essentially derived variety (EDV).15 These varieties share all the essential characteristics of a registered plant variety but are distinguishable from one another.  See information on PBR ['Additional rights available'](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/what-are-plant-breeders-rights/additional-rights-available).

**4. Someone uses harvested material**

Infringement can also occur if someone grows a protected plant variety without permission and harvests material from those plants (such as fruit or flowers).16 This can also include products made from material harvested from the protected variety (such as fruit juice).17",,"Plant breeder's rights (PBR) infringement

### What is not PBR infringement

It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The *Plant Breeders' Act 1994* provides several situations where a PBR is not infringed, including:

* Privately using the plant variety for non-commercial purposes.18
* Using the plant variety for experimental purposes.19
* Using the plant variety for breeding other plant varieties.20
* A farmer saves harvested propagating material (such as seeds) and uses that material for the production of further propagating material.21",,"Plant breeder's rights (PBR) infringement

Infringement of Plant Breeders' Rights (PBRs) can occur when someone uses a protected variety without the owner's permission. In Australia, PBRs last for up to 20 years or 25 years, depending on the plant type.
### Importance of Labelling

The *Plant Breeders' Act 1994*recognises that someone might unknowingly infringe a PBR. For instance, using a protected plant material without realising it was protected. Where a court finds infringement has occurred, it may refuse to award damages or to make an order for account of profits against an ""innocent"" infringer.22 For a person to be ""innocent"", they must satisfy the court that at the time of infringement, they were not aware that the plant material was protected.23

However, if the plant variety has been appropriately labelled to indicate its protection, the law assumes that the person should have been aware of its protection under a PBR.24\

This makes proper labelling crucial for owners. It not only informs people about existing rights but also prevents infringers from later claiming they were unaware of the protection. See more information about labelling here: '[How to label my protected plant variety](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/how-to-prevent-infringement-of-my-ip/how-to-label-my-protected-plant-variety) '.",,"Plant breeder's rights (PBR) infringement

### Example

Imagine Crisp Orchards has developed and registered a new apple variety with the name 'SweetCrunch'. The variety has a distinctive flavour, appearance, and storage qualities. They have obtained PBR protection in Australia.

**What would likely be an infringement**

* A competing orchard purchases a few 'SweetCrunch' trees and uses cuttings to propagate hundreds more trees without permission
* A nursery imports 'SweetCrunch' from overseas and grafts it onto rootstock to sell to local growers
* A grower obtains 'SweetCrunch' trees legitimately but then sells cuttings to other growers without permission.25

**What would unlikely be an infringement**

* A consumer purchasing and eating 'SweetCrunch' apples
* A farmer growing 'SweetCrunch' trees with permission from Crisp Orchards
* Using 'SweetCrunch' in a breeding program to develop a new and distinct variety

Determining patent infringement can be complex and often requires expertise in both legal and plant variety matters. For infringement to happen, the PBR must be legally valid. PBRs can be challenged if, for example, the variety is not new, distinct, uniform and stable (for more information, see [What are plant breeder's rights](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/what-are-plant-breeders-rights) ).26 An expert can also assess the available defences that can affect the outcome. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

### What is it?

If a registered trade mark is not being used by its owner, you may be able to have it removed from the Register. This allows you to potentially use a trade mark that you believe you have the right to use, even if someone else has registered it. 

You can request removal of a trade mark if you believe the owner: 

* hasn't used the trade mark in relation to all or some of their goods and/or services for 3 years
* never intended to use the trade mark
* hasn't used the trade mark in good faith.

If nobody opposes removal in the time allowed and the removal application is in order, the trade mark will be removed completely or in relation to specific goods and/or services to the extent specified in the application.

**When can you file an application for removal for non-use?** 

If you are filing an application for removal on the ground that the owner never intended to use the trade mark, then the application may be made at any time after the subject trade mark has been filed.

If you are filing an application for removal on the ground that the trade mark has not been used, the following timeframes would apply:

| **For trade marks with a filing date 23 February 2019 or earlier;** | **For trade marks with a filing date 24 February 2019 or later;** |
| --- | --- |
| You can file after **5 years** or more have passed since the *filing date* of the application (and if you believe that a trade mark hasn't been used in three years.)

### What are the benefits?

**Simple, fast and low-cost (when unopposed)**

Removal application can be a simple, fast and low-cost option when a registered trade mark in question has not been used in the marketplace for a considerable period of time, or when the owner of a trade mark does not use or intend to use the trade mark in good faith.  

If your application to remove a trade mark on the basis of non-use is unopposed, your request will be actioned following the two-month opposition period.  

* In about 60% of cases, removal applications will not lead to an adversarial process, as those who are genuinely not using their trade marks typically do not oppose the application for removal.",,"Remove a trade mark from the register

Trade mark non-use action
Request IP Australia removes an unused trade mark from the register.
### What are the risks?

**Escalation into further opposition process or court proceedings** 

After an application for removal has been filed and published, any person can oppose it within 2 months of the publishing date and tell IP Australia that they disagree that the trade mark has not been used. If you wish to respond to the opposition and establish that there is a case for removal based on non-use, this will lengthen the removal process and take up further cost, time and efforts.  

A party who is dissatisfied with IP Australia's decision can also appeal it to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court of Australia, which could be highly time-consuming and costly. 

**Exposure resulting from notification and publication** 

The owner and their representative of the trade mark which is subject to a removal procedure will be notified of your application to remove the trade mark. This notification happens within one month of filing the application. A copy of the application will be forwarded with the notification, which will include your details and the details of your filing. 

IP Australia also must give notice of the application for removal by publishing it on the Australian Trade Marks Search ('the Register'). This means that other parties would be aware of your identity and also your attempt to remove the trade mark from the Register. This may trigger the other party to oppose your application or initiate other forms of action (i.e. administrative hearings, court proceedings, etc.) against you and/or your business.",,"Remove a trade mark from the register

### What are the possible outcomes?

If the application for removal is advertised and no one opposes it within the required time: 

* The trade mark will be completely removed from the Register, or
* The trade mark will partially be removed from the Register, namely in relation to the goods and services as specified in your application for removal.

If the other party opposes your request to remove their trade mark within the two-month opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition.  

The person opposing the removal of the trade mark is required to establish, by filing evidence, that they have used the trade mark for the goods and services which are the subject of the removal application or that there are other circumstances justifying the non-use of the mark. 

IP Australia will follow the processes prescribed in the law to decide the outcome, which could be any of the following: 

* The trade mark will be completely, or partially, removed from the Register (as above).
* The Registrar decides the trade mark should remain registered.
* In rare cases, the scope of the registered mark is limited in some way (e.g. to a specific territory).",,"Remove a trade mark from the register

### What might the costs be?

The applicant must pay a fee of $350 for filing the removal application. The process can, however, incur further costs when your application is opposed -- For instance, IP Australia may decide in favour of the opposition and require you to pay the other party's costs.

### How much time might be involved?

If unopposed, your application to remove a trade mark will be advertised shortly after filing, and then the mark will be removed following the two-month opposition period. 

If someone opposes your application to remove the trade mark within opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition. You can do this by filing the ***Notice of intention to defend*** through IP Australia's [Manage my IP](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip)  page. If you choose not to file the Notice of intention to defend, your removal application will be taken as successfully opposed, and the trade mark will stay on the Register.  

However, if you choose to defend your removal application, more time will be taken by IP Australia to reach a final decision as it will need to allocate time for the parties to file evidence and submissions.",,"Remove a trade mark from the register

### What is it?

Being accused of IP infringement can be a distressing, and potentially confusing, experience. Having a qualified intellectual property (IP) lawyer or a trade marks or patent attorney on your side can help you make sense of an allegation that your product, branding or content is infringing someone else's IP.

Such professionals can help:

* explain the claim in plain language
* assess whether, or to what extent, the accusation has merit
* outline the full range of ways you may respond, from negotiating a quiet resolution through to defending the matter in court.

Depending on your situation, it may be necessary to seek advice from more than one type of IP professional specialising in IP for different rights in your IP portfolio and different types of enforcement actions (such as court action, which would require a lawyer).  

If you already have a trusted lawyer, trade marks or patent attorney, you might talk to them about finding the right IP professional for your circumstances. Alternatively, you could search the [Trans-Tasman IP Attorney Board](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm)  register to find a trade marks or patent attorney or contact your local law society to find a specialist IP lawyer.",,"Obtain legal advice on an accusation of infringment

* Most IP lawyers and IP attorneys have different specialties and may be more effective in their particular field of expertise. For instance, an IP lawyer may be highly experienced in dealing with trade marks, but not so much in patents, or vice versa. Only lawyers can conduct proceedings in a court so, if you engage an IP attorney rather than an IP lawyer, they would need to refer you to an IP lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.

### What might the costs be?

The total costs of engaging an IP lawyer or IP attorney will depend on factors such as their fees and other costs and the complexity of the matter.

For trade marks and patent attorneys, you can expect an average fee of:

* $500-1,000 per hour for a [patent attorney](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney).
* $1,000-2,000 total for a [trade marks attorney](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney)  to file and register a single trade mark in one or two classes of goods and services.

Fees for IP lawyers vary widely depending on factors such as their level of expertise, the size of the firm they work for, and where they are based. If an IP lawyer needs to engage a barrister to represent you in court proceedings, this will add to the costs involved.

Some IP lawyers and IP attorneys offer a free initial consultation to assess what services you need and to provide you with an estimate of costs moving forward. The Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia provides a service for free consultations. That service can be found [here](https://ipta.org.au/community/get-free-consultation/). It can be a good idea to ask for an indication of how much the entire process may cost during your first meeting. IP lawyers have a professional obligation to provide you with an upfront estimate of their fees and costs.",,"Obtain legal advice on an accusation of infringment

### What do you need to proceed?

**Do your homework before you meet**

Your time is important and an expert's time can be expensive, so it can be useful to prepare before you meet with an IP lawyer or IP attorney. Consider:

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

* [Learning more about IP](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/types-of-ip) and the specific IP type at the centre of the dispute. Having some basic knowledge will help you to better understand the professional's advice and recommendations.
* Researching what the person accusing you of IP infringement is doing in the market (including where they might be based and whether they have registered any IP rights) and being ready to share the results. This will help your IP lawyer or IP attorney to provide you with advice.

**Finding an IP lawyer or IP attorney**

**Tips for choosing an IP lawyer or IP attorney**

Here are some suggestions for choosing an IP lawyer or IP attorney for your IP:

* Ask for recommendations from other business owners or members of your industry association.
* Ask how much you'll be charged and how long the service will take.
* Don't assume that all IP lawyers or IP attorneys specialise in the type of IP that you have.
* Try to determine if you can establish a trusting relationship. If you don't feel comfortable sharing relevant information, it could be difficult for an adviser to work in your best interests.
* If you think you may need to go to court, speak to an IP lawyer rather than an IP attorney.",,"Obtain legal advice on an accusation of infringment

### What is it?

[![See information about what counts as infringement](/sites/default/files/images/2025-08/Infringement%20Button%20-%20tighter_2.png)](/node/208)

You may choose to stop using a particular piece of intellectual property (IP) that has been contested. For example, if you receive a letter of demand or cease and desist request from someone claiming you were using their IP without permission, and you stop using their IP. In some cases, this might resolve a dispute and avoid the issue escalating further. 

For information about evaluating a cease and desist letter or a letter of demand, see: [Receiving a letter of demand | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/receiving-letter-demand).

Even if you're unsure whether there is actual infringement happening, you may still elect to stop using the IP (at least temporarily) while you get advice from an IP lawyer or IP attorney. This can sometimes:  

* help to avoid escalating the conflict prematurely
* help to demonstrate that you are acting in good faith
* keep open the possibility of resolving the issue informally
* help to reduce your legal risks.

There is no formal process to comply with a request to stop using contested IP. It might include taking down products or copyrighted content, re-branding, stopping sales, changing your website, or returning stock. A business can decide to stop using the IP completely, or in part. If you are making this change in response to a request or demand from another party, it is important to inform the other party in writing, communicating the actions you have taken or are willing to take in response to their request, to prevent further escalation. You should note that in communicating with the other party, if you admit any fault or liability it will likely assist the other party's legal position against you.  

**Please note: Ceasing use of the contested IP alone may not be sufficient to prevent further escalation. It can also have negative consequences on your ability to respond to allegations of infringement or be seen as an admission of liability. Please consider carefully if you want to undertake this action and are fully aware of the risks involved. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you assess the strength of the allegations made against you and whether ceasing use of the contested IP is in your best interests.**",,"Pause use of contested IP until resolution

### What are the benefits?

* Can potentially de-escalate the situation and reduce the likelihood of expensive legal action or compensation claims - but often the other party will demand you do more than just stop using their IP. Other parties may still insist on other demands like you compensating them for your use of their IP up to the point where you stopped.
* Outcomes can be private where either the parties agree not to disclose the alleged infringement or they reach no formal agreement but neither party discloses it.
* Can show you're acting in good faith, which may help in future discussions, business dealings and negotiation - although this will depend on the nature of the alleged infringement.",,"Pause use of contested IP until resolution

* Ceasing use of contested IP may cause you to lose business revenue or incur business costs. This risk should be considered against the risk of further action against you if you do not cease use of contested IP.
* Ceasing use of contested IP may not prevent the IP owner seeking compensation for past use or otherwise taking further steps against you.
* The other party might see this action as conceding that you were infringing.

### What might the costs be?

Costs will vary significantly depending on the importance of the contested IP to your business, the extent of the IP usage and the specific requests made by the other party.  

Business costs involved in ceasing use of certain IP could include: 

* **Audit costs** - Such as reviewing your products, packaging, marketing, website, and systems.
* **Rebranding, redesign or replacement costs** -Such as changing labels, packaging or tooling; reprinting and developing marketing material, and redeveloping goodwill in your business with alternate branding.
* **Product changes or redesign** - If you need to make changes to your products to avoid using others' IP.
* **Increased business expenses** - using the contested IP may have allowed you to run your business more efficiently.
* **Disposal or loss -** Such as writing off unsellable stock or packaging; cancelling marketing or contracts early.
* **Loss of income or requirement to pay compensation** - If you've entered into IP licences or other contracts involving material or products that are alleged to infringe someone else's IP, you may lose expected payments such as licensing fees if you're required to stop using the material or product as agreed.

### How much time might be involved?

Time will vary depending on the circumstances and what you are changing. For instance, changing a website image could be done very quickly, where a full rebrand or product withdrawal could take weeks or months. 

Extra time might be needed to:

### What do you need to proceed?

* Look for all the ways the IP might be used in your business and for what would be involved in ceasing use of the IP.
* Decide what changes to make (remove, redesign or rebrand).
* Write to the alleged IP owner to explain what you've done, what you will do and when but note that admitting any fault or liability in your communications would likely assist IP owner's legal position against you.
* Keep clear records showing when you made changes (screenshots, shipping logs, letters).",,"Pause use of contested IP until resolution

### This right is currently not covered by the navigation tool

Information relevant to the enforcement of other types of IP has not been included as part of the platform's pilot. However, IP First Response contains general information which may be useful for the enforcement of all intellectual property. Consider exploring the enforcement options and whether they may still contain information that's useful for your situation.   

This tool is currently in early-stage development and testing, aimed at determining its usefulness to rights holders like you. We invite you to provide feedback about this navigator tool, IP First Response, and your experience enforcing your IP through our [IP First Response feedback form](https://ipaustralia.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6LKlgPWZqiheCiy)  and/or via email at [ipfirstresponse@ipaustralia.gov.au](mailto:ipfirstresponse@ipaustralia.gov.au)
