Court appeals are usually heard \n\nde novo\n\n, meaning the court re-hears the matter and can consider new evidence.\nAnother pathway is judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Judicial review focuses on whether there was a legal error in how the decision was made; it does not re-hear the facts.\nWhich path applies depends on your IP right and the type of decision.

We welcome any feedback via our IP First Response feedback form and by emailing us.\n\nThe Toyota story: What can SMEs learn from Toyota\'s approach to counterfeit products?\n\nWhat can businesses do to protect themselves against importation of counterfeits that might jeopardise their brand and their products? The story of Toyota provides insight into their use of the Australian Border Force\'s (ABF) Notice of Objection scheme.\n\nThe Toyota brand prides itself on having a reputation of quality and reliability among Australian drivers, with its vehicles being a common sight on roads across the country. The company\'s track record in quality and customer service has helped earn it a loyal customer base, with a market share of 19.5% in Australia and a new sales record in 2024.\n\nHowever, counterfeit vehicle parts pose a challenge to public safety and to Toyota\'s brand integrity. According to INTERPOL, counterfeit auto parts--including brake pads, airbags, and filters--are ""often substandard, causing health problems and injuries, even proving fatal. ""\n\nThe infiltration of such parts into the Australian market has far-reaching consequences--undermining consumer trust, jeopardising driver safety, and eroding the standards Toyota strives for. That\'s why Toyota proactively collaborates with the ABF using one of the options open to brands to combat the circulation of counterfeit products.\n\nThe role of IP in fighting counterfeits\n\nIntellectual property (IP), particularly trade marks and copyright, plays a critical role for Toyota\'s in protecting its brand and reputation. The unique Toyota branding, including the word Toyota and its emblem, prevents consumer confusion by ensuring that products bearing the Toyota brand originate from authorised sources and meet Toyota\'s quality standards. When consumers see the Toyota logo, they know what they are getting.\n\nBut when these rights are infringed, the risk extends beyond brand damage. Counterfeit parts that misuse Toyota\'s branding can deceive consumers and introduce serious safety hazards, particularly when critical components are involved.\n\nIP enforcement is therefore both a commercial and consumer protection priority. It provides the legal basis for identifying and removing fake goods from the market, helping ensure that consumers can have confidence in their purchase of Toyota goods.\n\nToyota\'s use of the Notice of Objection scheme\n\nToyota and ABF officers participating in an IP Enforcement workshop hosted by the ABF (image supplied by the ABF)\n\nToyota\'s journey in protecting its IP rights begins with the detection of infringements. The company actively gathers intelligence on counterfeit products through a range of channels. One of the major sources of detection information comes from the ABF through its Notice of Objection Scheme.\n\nThe scheme allows the ABF to engage Toyota\'s commercial information to identify counterfeit from legitimate products. Toyota\'s IP assists the ABF in the identification and seizure of counterfeit goods at the point of import, preventing dangerous and unauthorised products from reaching Australian consumers.\n\nThe scheme has been particularly useful for:\n\n* Intercepting counterfeit goods at the border and safeguarding consumers from unauthorised imports falsely marketed as ""Toyota"" products, which can potentially compromise consumer safety and the integrity of their vehicles.\n* Understanding unlawful importation trends concerning parts and accessories. Without a Notice of Objection in place, Toyota may not be aware of the existence of these products in the market. For example, through a notice of seizure, Toyota became aware of the importation of counterfeit products such as fake airbags and steering wheels.\n* Performing testing on product imitation to analyse counterfeit products and understand risks associated with using fake parts. From time to time, Toyota requests a sample of a fake part from the ABF seizure before they are forfeited for physical verification. This verification process allows Toyota to learn more about these fake parts and compare them side by side with genuine Toyota products.\n* Obtaining available information from ABF should Toyota commence a legal action -- Toyota may choose to institute a court proceeding against the importer of counterfeit products when the importer makes a claim for release of seized products. However, Toyota is committed to taking genuine steps to resolve disputes before commencing a legal action.\n\nABF have consistently demonstrated a high level of expertise in identifying and intercepting unlawful goods, allowing Toyota to detect fake ""Toyota"" parts and accessories before they enter the market. However, as outlined above, the benefits of using the Scheme can go beyond physical interception of counterfeit products, providing additional information about trends in unlawful importation, looks and quality of fake products, and identity of the entities involved.\n\nThe insights and evaluations obtained from border seizures further enhance the collaborative efforts of Toyota and ABF to identify and prevent counterfeit products from entering the market. For example, Toyota\'s Brand Protection team has been a regular participant in IP Enforcement Workshops hosted by the ABF in different ports across the country to provide latest information and training on counterfeit products to ABF officers.\n\nHowever, counterfeit parts are getting increasingly sophisticated. They can look similar in appearance to the genuine products. In some cases, they are indistinguishable to the naked eye. Therefore, other brand protection strategies and mechanisms are implemented by Toyota to assist with a comprehensive approach to brand protection.\n\nOne tool among many in the IP enforcement portfolio\n\nABF officers inspecting automobile parts in an IP Enforcement workshop hosted by the ABF (image supplied by the ABF)\n\nWhen suspected counterfeit products are seized, both the importer and Toyota are notified of the seizure in writing by the ABF. If the importer makes a claim for release of seized goods within ten working days of notification, Toyota will be notified and will also have ten working days to commence a legal action.\n\nHowever, Toyota aims to adopt a legal, proportionate, and commercially pragmatic approach to their enforcement of their IP. Their enforcement strategy may include:\n\n* Verifying Toyota\'s IP rights relevant to the alleged infringement\n* Legal assessment of the infringing conduct against the legislative framework\n* Engaging in correspondence and negotiation with the infringing party\'s legal representation.\n\nOutcome and finalisation\n\nToyota\'s use of the Notice of Objection Scheme shows the way in which businesses can work with the ABF, for a mutually beneficial outcome, to stop counterfeit products entering the Australian market. This mechanism also highlights how IP protection can prevent the circulation of low-quality counterfeit products that might otherwise jeopardise public health and safety.\n\nToyota\'s approach also highlights how IP enforcement may involve a range of different options as part of a comprehensive proactive approach to IP.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Want to give us feedback?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'Send us an email.\\\nFill out our feedback form.'}}]}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://ipaustralia.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6LKlgPWZqiheCiy', 'name': '*IP First Response feedback form*'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'mailto:IPFirstResponse@IPAustralia.gov.au?subject=Feedback%20on%20IP%20First%20Response', 'name': '*emailing us*'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.abf.gov.au/help-and-support-subsite/Pages/notices/intellectual-property.aspx#:~:text=A%20Notice%20of%20Objection%20is,a%20valid%20Notice%20of%20Objection.', 'name': ""Australian Border Force's (ABF) Notice of Objection scheme""}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.drive.com.au/news/toyota-annual-sales-record-2024-australia/', 'name': 'with a market share of 19.5% in Australia and a new sales record in 2024'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.interpol.int/en/Crimes/Illicit-goods/Illicit-goods-the-issues', 'name': 'often substandard, causing health problems and injuries, even proving fatal.'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'mailto:ipfirstresponse@ipaustralia.gov.au', 'name': 'email'}]}"

See more information here \'\n\nHow to apply for a design right\n\n\'.\n\nWhen it comes to design infringement, it is essential to understand what a registered design protects.\nDesigns are tied to specific products\n\n. Designs are registered for a particular product (like ""a chair"" or ""a bottle""). Protection only covers the appearance of that product. If someone uses the exact design on a completely different product, this may not be infringement. For example, a chair design is used as a pattern on a t-shirt.\nWhat is shown with the registered design is what is protected\n\n.

A familiar person is someone who is familiar with the product and similar products.19They consider whether someone familiar with these types of products thinks they look too similar.\n\n* The field for prior designs. If the registered design is more innovative and distinct from existing designs, common features between the design and the infringing design would support a finding of infringement. On the other hand, if the registered design is only slightly different from existing designs, small differences between the registered design and the infringing design support a finding of no infringement.20\n\n* Common features. Features that are common in many similar products are given less importance.21\n\n* Design options. Courts will consider how many different ways a designer could create a design for the product.22\n\n* Statement of Newness and Distinctiveness.

Common forms of ADR include mediation, expert determination, arbitration.\nADR happens with the help of an independent third party and only goes ahead if everyone agrees to take part. Because ADR is private and tailored, it may suit situations where you want to keep a business relationship, control what information becomes public, or simply avoid the cost and stress of court proceedings. Outcomes may include negotiated undertakings, such as written promises to stop using the IP, or custom licence terms.\nYou can engage ADR through both public providers such as the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO), or private ADR specialists. Fees are set by the provider and are usually shared between the parties.\nADR is available for all IP rights in Australia and can be used at any stage before, during or after court action has begun, so long as both parties consent.

It can be a preventative method used prior to an actual dispute, where parties may have encountered a roadblock. It can also be used in early stages of disputes, when parties fail to reach a resolution on their own. Lastly, you may even engage in mediation during more formal dispute resolution processes (that is, litigation or arbitration).\nWhile mediation can be ordered by court, it is often a voluntary process whereby disputing parties agree to negotiate an outcome with help from a mediator.

Costs usually rise with urgency, complexity and the number of parties involved.\nYou need to show that you own the right and that the other party's conduct likely infringes it. That can mean searches, collecting screenshots or records, and getting expert views. Each step takes time and money.\nLegal help adds cost. Many steps use specialist lawyers or IP attorneys to provide opinions, draft letters, negotiate, prepare evidence and, if needed, file hearing or court documents. Professional time is charged, and costs can rise with the number of issues, documents and parties involved.\nFormal dispute resolution processes such as court proceedings or administrative hearings can be complex. Filing and serving documents, discovery, witness statements, expert reports and hearings all often add time and cost. Even simple-looking disputes can become detailed once evidence and procedure are involved.\nUrgency can increase cost. If you need quick orders (for example, an interlocutory injunction), the team may need to work fast and at short notice. Compressing months of tasks into days can be costly.\nTechnical or cross-border issues add to the bill. Patent and design disputes can need technical experts. If the problem spans other countries, you may need local advisers, as Australian rights mainly apply in Australia. IP rights are territorial, so enforcement depends on each country's system.\nMultiple sellers and platforms multiply effort. Stopping many small sellers, listings or shipments can mean repeating steps across marketplaces and channels. That repeat work adds up because each marketplace has its own process.\nCourt cases can lead to an order that you pay some of the other side's legal costs if you lose.\n\n This usual rule, called 'costs follow the event', is a normal feature of Australian court proceedings, and it is one reason parties seek to settle earlier.\nLower-cost paths exist.\n\n Many disputes resolve through negotiation or mediation (which is a form of alternative dispute resolution, 'ADR'), including with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center or accredited mediators within Australia. These still need preparation but can be faster and less costly than going to court. The Federal Court of Australia can also order mediation that may reduce time and cost.\nSeveral things can influence your spend. Clear records, sensible contracts and early, calm contact can sometimes reduce effort. Having registered rights can make proof quicker and provide a stronger negotiating position."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/why-so-expensive'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/all-enforcement-options', 'name': 'All enforcement options | IP Australia First Response'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ADR', 'name': 'Resolve conflicts with the help of experienced facilitators   | IP Australia First Response'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/someone-is-using-my-ip', 'name': 'Someone is using my IP | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ASBFEO', 'name': 'Access help tailored to resolve business disputes  | IP Australia First Response'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/', 'name': 'Alternative Dispute Resolution | WIPO AMC'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/services/ADR/mediation', 'name': 'Mediation | Federal Court of Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/law-and-practice/practice-documents/practice-notes/gpn-costs', 'name': 'Costs Practice Note (GPN-COSTS) | Federal Court of Australia'}]}"

You might prefer to protect certain know-how and knowledge as trade secrets, rather than seeking registration of IP.\nConsider timing risks and benefits.\n\n Avoiding registration can mean someone else files first, or that public use affects your options. Registration can make it easier to act on suspected copycats and can support deals like licensing or investment. However, IP registers are publicly accessible, meaning that competitors can find information about your IP registrations or applications.\nCheck whether your idea meets the basic requirements for registration.\n\nBelow are some of the basic requirements for each registrable IP type:\n* Patents must be new and inventive compared with what is already public.\n\n* Designs must be new and distinctive.\n\n* Trade marks need to be capable of distinguishing your goods or services. Also, they cannot be identical or too similar to earlier trade marks that are applied for or registered in Australia.\n\n* PBRs need a new, distinct, uniform and stable variety.\nThere are many other formal and legal requirements for IP to be deemed as valid or registrable. Assessing whether your IP meets all legal requirements for registration is a complex process - It is common for people to engage professional services from IP lawyers or IP attorneys to obtain advice on this point and assistance in the overall registration process.\n(For patents, designs, and PBRs only) Think about what has already been made public.\n\n Showing an invention or design before you file can affect your options. Australia often allows a 12-month grace period for patents and designs, but relying on this can be risky and conditions apply. Using confidentiality agreements when testing or pitching can help you keep options open.\nConfirm who owns it.\n\n If employees, contractors or partners helped creating it, check contracts so the right person or business is named as the applicant.\nRun availability and clearance checks relevant to the type of IP\n\n:\n* Search theAustralian Trade Mark Search (ATMS)and useTM Checkerto spot lookalike brands.\n\n* Search global patent databases for similar inventions and design databases for similar product looks.\n\n* Search global plant variety registers if you plan to apply for PBRs.\n\n* Do a quick web and marketplace scan to see what is already out there.\nRemember that\n\n \n\nIP rights are territorial, meaning that Australian registrations protect you in Australia\n\n. Protection overseas usually needs separate applications. You may want to seek registration with national IP offices in other countries, if you are thinking of operating in overseas markets.\nGet your evidence and documents together.\n\nFor your patent, design or PBR applications, make sure you keep dated notes and drafts, drawings or photos, and any testing results. While such 'evidence' is not required for trade mark applications, keeping note of the date you first used the brand and examples of packaging or advertising can help you down the track should your application run into an objection or opposition during the examination process.\nApplications involve government fees and can take time to examine\n\n. You may need to respond to objections raised by examiners, or an opposition process initiated by third parties."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/what-check-getting-registered-ip'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/tools-and-research/business-resources/choosing-the-right-ip-tool', 'name': 'matching what you have to the right IP type.'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/quick', 'name': 'Australian Trade Mark Search (ATMS)'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/search-existing-trade-marks/tm-checker', 'name': 'TM Checker'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks', 'name': 'Trade marks | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents', 'name': 'Patents | IP Australia'}]}"

By matching your current activities to common stages in the IP journey, you can quickly see what's most relevant now and what might come next.\n'Where am I in the IP journey?' is a way to help pinpoint your stage in protecting and using your IP. Businesses take different IP steps depending on whether they're just starting out, developing a product, protecting it, commercialising, or expanding.\nKnowing your stage can help you focus your attention and avoid missing protections that are easier to put in place early. The IP journey often follows five broad stages:\n1. Idea and readiness\n\n \n\nYou're here if you're still shaping your concept and testing whether it has real-world value. You may be:\n* Checking whether your idea is unique and protectable, such as by conducting some internet research and searching for existingtrade marks,patents,designsandplant breeders' rights(PBRs).\n\n* Protecting original material with copyright (automatically created when certain conditions are met) and keeping details confidential using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) during prototype testing.\n\n* Conducting early market research and'freedom to operate'checks to identify any existing rights you might risk infringing.\n\n* Not necessarily set up a business structure yet, secured funding, or registered any IP rights.\n2. Development\n\n \n\nThis is the stage where you turn an idea into something market-ready. You may be:\n* Creating prototypes or running service trials.\n\n* Collaborating with partners, suppliers, or researchers.\n\n* Running more detailed freedom-to-operate searches to avoid infringing others' rights.\n\n* Deciding whether to apply for trade marks, designs, patents, or PBRs.\n\n* Beginning to think about how registered IP could make your business more attractive to potential investors.\n3. Protection\n\n \n\nHere you've started locking in your rights. You may be:\n* Applying for, or registering, relevant IP rights in Australia and any other countries you plan to use the IP.\n\n* Understanding that Australian IP rights only apply within Australia - protection in other countries usually requires separate applications, sometimes using agreements like the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). There is no single 'international patent' or a 'global trade mark'.\n\n* Putting systems in place to safeguard confidential information, trade secrets, and your brand.\n\n* Making sure your IP strategy fits your business goals and timelines.\n4. Commercialisation\n\n \n\nYour IP is now part of how you make money. You may be:\n* Selling, licensing, or otherwise monetising your product or service.\n\n* Securing IP rights before going to market to help protect your competitive position.\n\n* Choosing your commercialisation model, such as franchising or partnering.\n\n* Actively marketing your brand andmonitoring competitorsfor suspected infringement.\n\n* Using registered IP to help build investor confidence in your business model.\n5. Growth and expansion\n\n \n\nThis stage is about scaling and staying competitive. You may be:\n* Entering new markets, in Australia or overseas, and considering IP protection in each new location - as registered rights do not automatically extend beyond Australia.\n\n* Managing a growing IP portfolio, including new rights for new products or services.\n\n* Continuing research and development to keep your edge.\nThese stages are not always strictly linear - you might revisit earlier steps as your business changes."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/discover-where-you-are-your-ip-journey'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/search-existing-trade-marks/tm-checker', 'name': 'trade marks'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/check-your-idea-against-existing-patents', 'name': 'patents'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/designs/search/quick?_gl=1%2as1ag7s%2a_ga%2aMTExMjM3MjAxNi4xNjM1ODI2Nzc1%2a_ga_QX1TTWEZ1L%2aMTY0NDUzMTQzMy4xMjUuMS4xNjQ0NTMxNTY0LjA', 'name': 'designs'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://ipsearch.ipaustralia.gov.au/pbr/', 'name': ""plant breeders' rights""}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/monitor-trade-mark-register-and-market-competitor-activity', 'name': 'monitoring competitors'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.wipo.int/en/web/business/checklist', 'name': 'A step-by-step IP Strategy Checklist for SMEs'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/tools-and-research/business-resources', 'name': 'Business Resources | IP Australia'}]}"

For patents, it includes whether the product or process contains all the essential features of a claim in a granted patent. For copyright, you could consider whether any exceptions or statutory licence under copyright law may apply that could have enabled the use of the material in question without your permission. For more information about copyright exceptions, seeCopyright infringement | IP Australia First Response.\nThe identity and contact details of the suspected infringer. It's important to send the letter to the correct party. You might wish to consider sending correspondence by registered mail, and keeping records to show that a letter was sent to a specific address on a particular date.

Official IP Australia will come from @ipaustralia.gov.au.\n\n* The message uses a generic greeting, has spelling mistakes, or your IP details are wrong or incomplete.\n\n* There is pressure to 'pay now' or threats of court action for 'alleged infringement' without clear case details.\n\n* Payment is requested to an overseas account, by gift cards, or in cryptocurrency.\n\n* Links point to a site that looks unusual or is not on a trusted government domain. Also, never click links in an unexpected email.\n\n* The claimed 'IP attorney' or 'law firm' cannot be found onthe Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board registeror a relevant law society register (e.g.Register of Solicitors | The Law Society of NSW) .\nYou can also confirm any official notice by logging into IP Australia's \n\nOnline Services\n\n.\nIf you suspect a scam, you may wish to report it to \n\nScamwatch\n\n or \n\nReportCyber\n\n, and keep any evidence such as screenshots or email headers."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/common-scams'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm', 'name': 'the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board register'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.lawsociety.com.au/register-of-solicitors', 'name': 'Register of Solicitors | The Law Society of NSW'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/someone-is-using-my-ip/how-to-challenge-someone-elses-ip/opposition-hearings', 'name': 'Online Services'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/', 'name': 'Scamwatch'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/report', 'name': 'ReportCyber'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/report-scam-fraud-or-risk-public-interest', 'name': 'Report a scam, fraud or risk to public interest | IP Australia First Response'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/fraud-and-corruption/scams-related-to-managing-ip-rights#:~:text=false%20and%20confusing%20information, create%20a%20sense%20of%20urgency', 'name': 'Scams related to managing IP Rights | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/fraud-and-corruption/identifying-unofficial-invoices-and-registers', 'name': 'Identifying unofficial invoices and registers | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/doing-business-with-us/fraud-and-corruption', 'name': 'Fraud and corruption | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip', 'name': 'Manage my IP | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.qls.com.au/register-of-solicitors', 'name': 'Register of Solicitors'}]}"

Like physical assets, they can grow in value over time - but only if you take steps to protect them.\nRegistering an IP right involves applying through IP Australia for a trade mark, patent, design, or plant breeder's right. Once granted or registered (and certified for design rights), these rights are legally recognised and easier to enforce. They can also become long-term business assets that you can sell, license, or use to attract investment.\nHowever, 'protection' doesn't always mean registering IP. Copyright, for example, applies automatically to original works like writing, art, music, or software. Confidential information can be protected through contracts, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Trade marks can sometimes be defended under 'common law', though this is usually harder and more expensive than relying on a registered trade mark.\nContexts where a registered right may be preferred include:\n* When your brand or invention is central to your business identity or growth.\n\n* If you need clear proof of ownership to show to investors, buyers, or lenders.\n\n* When you want confidence to expand into new markets, including overseas.\n\n* Where stopping competitors from copying is critical to your business model.\nOn the other hand, if your work is short-lived, fast-moving, or unlikely to be copied, automatic protections, contracts or trade secrets may be enough. Many small businesses use a mix of registered and unregistered protections, depending on the stage they are at and what value they see in their ideas.\nRegistration is therefore not the only way.

In contrast, there may be no infringement if a similar sign is used for completely different goods or services.\n\n9\nHowever, the law does protect well-known trade marks in some cases.\n\n10\n\n Infringement \n\ncan\n\n occur when a well-known trade mark is used in relation to goods or services unrelated to the registered trade mark.\n\n11'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'How does trade mark infringement happen?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'Where a trade mark is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:\n1. Someone\n\nuses\n\na sign ""as a trade mark""\nThis is a crucial requirement. The infringer must use the sign as a \'badge of origin,\'\n\n12\n\n or in other words, to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services.\n\n13\n\n This involves using the trade mark to identify or differentiate their products or services in the marketplace.\n\n14\n\n This requirement limits infringement and allows for legitimate references to trade marks in contexts that do not suggest commercial origin.\nExamples of use as a trade\n\nmark\n\n:\n* Applying the sign to product packaging or labels15\n\n* Using the sign in advertising to promote goods or services16\n\n* Displaying the sign on business signage or storefronts17\n\n* Using the sign on websites to market products18\nExamples that are not use as a\n\ntrade\n\nmark:\n* Using a word in its ordinary descriptive sense (e.g., using ""apple"" to refer to the fruit)19\n\n* Referring to a trade mark for informational purposes20\n\n* Using a sign purely for functional or decorative purposes21\n2. Someone uses an almost \n\nidentical \n\ntrade mark or one that is similar enough to confuse people\nThis is when someone uses a trade mark that resembles or sounds almost exactly like a registered trade mark,\n\n22\n\n with only tiny differences that would go unnoticed by most consumers.\nFor example,\n\n suppose the word ""KOALA COMFORTS"" is a registered trade mark for bedding products. In that case, using ""KOALA KOMFORTS"" (just changing the spelling) for similar products would likely be considered too similar. Alternatively, someone uses a trade mark that, despite having some differences, is too similar to the registered trade mark. This similarity is likely to confuse consumers about who produces the product or provides the services.\n\n23\n\n For instance, it may look or sound similar enough to a registered trade mark.\nFor example,\n\n if ""BLUE WAVE"" with a wave picture is a registered trade mark for surfboards (see below), using ""BLU WAIVES"" with a similar wave design for surf gear could confuse customers into thinking they are from the same company.\n\nWhen looking at possible trade mark infringement, courts compare the registered trade mark with the alleged infringing trade mark and consider:\n* How similar the trade marks look and sound24\n\n* The impression left by the trade marks25\n\n* Whether the trade marks convey the same idea26\n\n* Where and how the products are sold27\n\n* Whether the typical customer would take the time to notice differences28\n\n* Whether anyone has actually been confused.29\n3. Using the mark on the same or similar goods\n\nor\n\nservices\nLastly, the trade mark is used to sell goods or services that are the same or similar to those listed in the registered trade mark. Therefore, infringement can still occur even when the trade mark is used for goods or services that are not identical to those covered by a registered trade mark but are similar or closely related.\n\n30\nFor example,\n\n if ""SUNNY DAYS"" is registered for coffee, using ""SUNNY DAYS"" for soft drinks might infringe because both products are related to non-alcoholic beverages.\n\n31\n\n Customers might think the same company makes them.\nAgain, courts consider several factors when determining whether goods or services are similar or closely related.\n\n32\nAlternatively, infringement can occur when someone uses a \'well known\' trade mark in relation to goods or services unrelated to those listed in the registration.\n\n33\n\n However, this kind of infringement has not been heard much in court, and its scope is not currently clear.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What is not trade markinfringement?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The \n\nTrade Marks Act 1995\n\n provides several situations where a trade mark is not infringed, including a person who is:\n* using their own name in good faith as a trade mark.34\n\n* just describing the goods or services, or stating where your business is located.35\n\n* indicating the intended purpose of the goods or services (like ""fits iPhone models"").36\n\n* comparing the goods or services to others.37\n\n* using an already registered trade mark.38\n\n* using a trade mark that they could obtain registration for.39\n\n* using a mark that they had before the other mark was registered.40\n\n* re-selling or re-distributing goods that initially used the mark with the owner\'s permission (including parallel imports41'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Understanding theboundariesof protection?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'It is essential to recognise that trade mark protection has limitations. Let\'s say, for example, you register ""SMARTBREW"" for coffee machines\n\n \n\n(listed under class 11) and coffee beans (listed under class 30). Potential infringement situations include:\n* Clear infringement:Another business begins selling coffee machines using the name ""SMARTBREW""The alleged infringing mark is being used as a trade mark (it is on the machine and advertising). The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" are identical. The alleged infringing mark is being used for identical products (coffee machines).\n\n* Possible infringement:Another business starts selling coffee filters using ""STARTBREW"". The business is using ""STARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging). The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" look similar and sound similar. Consumers might be confused about where they came from. The mark is being used on related but not identical goods. Courts would consider how similar these goods are.\n\n* Unlikely to be infringement:A company uses ""SMARTBREW"" for completely unrelated goods like gardening tools. The business is using ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging). The marks are identical, but the company uses the trade mark on goods that differ from the registered trade mark.\n\n* Not infringement:A coffee critique writes a review of the product entitled ""Is SmartBrew worth the money?""The article\'s author is not using the word ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark.\n\n* Not infringement:Another company uses a different coffee-related name, like ""CLEVER COFFEE"", for coffee machines. The business is using ""CLEVER COFFEE"" as a trade mark. However, ""CLEVER COFFEE"" and the registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" are too dissimilar.\nNavigating trade mark infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Additionally, the registered trade mark must be legally valid. A registered trade mark may be challenged in court and sought to be cancelled during a claim of infringement. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice.

The word 'suspected' is used because only a court can decide if infringement has actually occurred - but that doesn't mean you cannot take action.\nDifferent types of IP are protected in different ways. You can only take action if your IP is protected by a specific right such as a registered trade mark, granted patent, certified design, or copyright.\nIf you don't have formal IP rights, it may still be possible to take action, but it can be harder. Some legal protections may still apply under consumer law, contract law or common law-but these usually require help from a legal professional.\nStart by working out:\n* What exactly has been copied-your logo, invention, product, written work, name, style or something else.\n\n* Whether what's been copied is actually protected by a registered or automatic IP right.\n\n* Whether the use is actually unauthorised or illegal - some uses may be allowed, or may not amount to infringement under the law.\nIt's not always obvious whether infringement has happened. Even when someone copies your work, it may not be illegal.

In reality, each country has its own intellectual property (IP) office. For instance, IP Australia examines and registers patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeder's rights (PBRs) for protection inside Australia.\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) helps countries work together on IP and provides systems to simplify applying for rights overseas. However, it is not a global IP office that grants or enforces rights.\nWIPO's core role is to administer international treaties, maintain global IP databases and provide systems that streamline applications across borders. It helps countries adopt consistent rules and offers tools businesses can use when expanding overseas. Key examples include:\n* The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). This allows you to file one application to seek patent protection in 158 Contracting States.\n\n* The Madrid System. This provides a single-application path for registering trade marks in over 130 territories.\n\n* The Hague System. This is an international route for protecting industrial designs in multiple countries.\n\n* The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center. These services may resolve cross-border IP disputes without going to court.\nBecause WIPO focuses on coordination and policy development, national IP offices keep control of day-to-day tasks such as filing applications, examining rights, registration and renewal.\nWhen your business grows beyond Australia, you may use WIPO's 'single-application' process to streamline filing. However, the national IP office in each country still decides whether to grant protection in its jurisdiction under its own laws.\nIn short, WIPO is a hub for international treaty development and shared services, while national offices like IP Australia remain the home base for securing IP rights within their territories."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/there-global-ip-office'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/someone-is-using-my-ip', 'name': 'Someone is using my IP | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/international-ip/how-to-apply-for-ip-overseas#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20ways%20to, as%20entering%20the%20national%20phase.', 'name': 'How to apply for IP overseas | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/international-ip/update-and-renew-overseas-ip/prevent-international-infringement', 'name': 'Prevent international infringement | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/', 'name': 'Inside WIPO'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.wipo.int/en/web/pct-system', 'name': 'PCT - The International Patent System'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.wipo.int/en/web/madrid-system', 'name': 'WIPO Madrid System - International Trademark Protection'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.wipo.int/en/web/hague-system', 'name': 'Hague System - The International Design System'}]}"

Whether it is a brand name, invention, design, or creative work, using something similar to someone else's existing intellectual property may be considered infringement.\nAn IP owner may contact you informally, seeking an amicable resolution, or formally, with a letter from a lawyer demanding that the infringement stop. Alternatively, IP owners might initiate legal action, requesting a court to stop you from using a brand, design, or technology, or to compel you to pay damages to the IP owner. In some instances, you may be required to destroy products or marketing materials.\nIt is crucial to understand that you can infringe on someone's IP rights without even knowing those rights exist. While you might not have to pay monetary compensation (called damages) to the IP owner if you genuinely had no reason to believe the IP existed, you can still be ordered to stop using the IP.\nUnderstanding how to avoid infringing on others' rights from the beginning can save your business from serious consequences. With awareness and careful planning, you can minimise the risk of infringing on others' intellectual property rights.""}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Avoiding ip infringement?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '1. Conduct searches before you invest\nOne of the most effective ways to avoid IP infringement is to check for existing rights before committing to a new venture. For example, before launching a new product, brand, or service, you should search the Australian trade mark register using IP Australia\'s \n\nAustralian Trade Mark Search\n\n, check design registers for similar registered designs through the \n\nAustralian Design Search\n\n, check plant varieties on \n\nthe Australian PBR Search,\n\n and search patents on \n\nthe Australian Patent Search\n\n if you are developing new technology.\nHowever, not all intellectual property is registered with IP Australia. For instance, individuals are not required to register their copyright in original creative works. In this case, start by cataloguing all the content you plan to use. Such material can include text, images, videos, music, and graphics. Knowing precisely what you have will simplify your search. After that, conduct a quick online search for key phrases or images in your work. Using reverse image search tools (such as Google Images or TinEye) can help identify copied visuals. For text, paste sections into a search engine or utilise plagiarism checkers (such as Turnitin or Grammarly).\nBy searching first, you can avoid unintentionally infringing on others\' intellectual property rights.\nFor example,\n\n a Melbourne café owner wanted to name their business ""The Daily Grind"". A quick trade mark search revealed several similar registered marks in the food services class, prompting them to choose a different name before investing in signage and marketing.\n2. Create original work\nThe safest way to avoid infringement is to create original content. This approach applies to brand names and logos, product designs, marketing materials, website content, and product packaging. By creating something original, you not only avoid infringing on others\' rights but also build valuable IP assets.\nFor example,\n\ninstead of copying a competitor\'s product packaging, a small cosmetics company hired a graphic designer to develop distinct packaging that reflected their brand values while avoiding existing designs.\n3. Understand what you can and cannot use\nNot all uses of others\' IP require permission. Australian law permits specific uses without the IP owner\'s consent. For instance, under copyright law, \'fair dealing\' exceptions allow limited use of copyright material for particular purposes, such as research, criticism, or parody.\nYou can also use IP where the rights have expired. However, be cautious, as some rights may still be eligible for renewal.\n4. Get permission when needed\nObtaining proper permission is essential if you want to use someone else\'s IP. This means securing a written agreement (often called a licence) that outlines what you can and cannot do with the IP. A verbal agreement or an email may seem sufficient at the time, but written documentation safeguards both parties and prevents future misunderstandings.\nIt is a good idea to maintain thorough records of all permissions granted, understand any limitations on the use of the IP, and consider obtaining professional legal advice for complex arrangements.\n5. Be cautious with online content\nThe internet can create a false sense that content is freely available for use. However, just because something appears online does not mean it is free to use, and do not assume that attribution alone makes copying acceptable. Images, text, and videos are typically protected by copyright from the moment they are created. Company names and logos are often registered trade marks, and product designs may be protected by registered design rights.

They can also make your business more valuable by protecting what makes it unique. For example, a registered trade mark can help stop competitors from using a brand name or logo that is too similar to yours. Many businesses use IP to secure investment, create partnerships, or licence their creations to others. This can open up new revenue streams and help build customer trust in your brand.\nThe main types of IP rights in Australia are:\n* Patents- Protect inventions and new ways of doing things.\n\n* Trade marks- Protect brand identifiers like names, logos, and slogans.\n\n* Designs- Protect the visual appearance of a product.\n\n* Plant breeder's rights (PBRs)- Protect new plant varieties.\n\n* Copyright- Protects original works such as books, music, software, and art.\nSome IP rights need to be registered through IP Australia, like patents, designs, and PBRs. While trade marks can be used without registration, some enforcement options are only available for registered trade marks.\nCopyright is automatic when you create certain types of works, but registration is available for some kinds of copyright in other countries.\nHolding an IP right can make it easier to take action against suspected infringement, including using legal processes to stop the use, sale, or import of copies.

We use the term \'legal professional\' to refer to professionals who aren\'t necessarily lawyers, such as IP attorneys. IP attorneys (registered patent or trade mark attorneys) are not necessarily lawyers, but they are qualified to provide information about protecting IP.\nMany IP lawyers and IP attorneys have specialties relating to particular industries or situations, and may be more effective in their particular field of expertise. For instance, some IP lawyers may specialise and be highly experienced in dealing with trade marks, but less experienced with patents.\n\nBoth an IP lawyer or IP attorney can provide you with advice and act for you at different stages of IP protection and enforcement. Read below to consider which is most appropriate for your needs.\n\nTrade mark attorneys\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Specialists in trade marks who focus on obtaining and maintaining registered IP rights to protect brands (names, logos, slogans) and support business growth.\n\nProfessional standards:\n\nAttorneys must be registered with the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board. They are required to complete ongoing education, and are bound by strict professional and ethical standards.\n\nHow they can help (for example):\n\n* Advise whether a brand is registrable and run clearance searches to identify conflicts.\n\n* Prepare and lodge trade mark applications in Australia and some other countries; manage renewals and ownership changes.\n\n* Help respond to objections and file oppositions with IP Australia in relation to trade mark applications.\n\n* Advise on brand strategy and related IP options where appropriate.\n\n* Monitor competitors and support steps to enforce rights.\n\n* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.\n\n* Assist with licensing.\n\n* Advise on possible infringement risks relating to others\' rights.\n\nWhat they don\'t do:\n\n \n\n \n\nA trade mark attorney cannot provide general legal advice and can\'t conduct proceedings in a court. If you engage an IP attorney, they would need to refer you to a lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.\n\nWhere to find one:\n\n \n\n \n\nYou can find a qualified IP attorney to assist you on the Trans-Tasman Attorneys Board website:\u202f\n\nFind an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board\n\n.\u202f\n\n \n\nBenefits of using an IP attorney |Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Regulation\n\nPatent attorneys\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Specialists in patent law and practice with in-depth knowledge of one or more fields of science or technology, used to help protect inventions.\n\nProfessional standards:\n\nAttorneys must be registered with the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board. They are required to complete ongoing education, and are bound by strict professional and ethical standards.\n\n \n\nHow they can help (for example but not limited to):\n\n* Assess whether an idea might be protectable by a patent and conduct prior-art searches.\n\n* Draft and file patent applications in Australia, and advise on timing and jurisdictions aligned to business goals.\n\n* Provide strategies to protect inventions and to monitor competitors\' activity.\n\n* Assist in patent office processes (e.g. examination, oppositions).\n\n* Advise on other IP options (for example, designs, trade marks and protection of trade secrets).\n\n* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.\n\n* Monitor competitors and support steps to enforce rights.\n\n* Assist with licensing and technology transfer.\n\n* Conduct IP audits to identify protectable ideas and potential gaps.\n\n* Advise on possible infringement risks relating to others\' rights.\n\n* Help you commercialise ideas in a way that supports business growth.\n\nWhat they don\'t do:\n\n \n\n \n\nA patent attorney cannot provide general legal advice and can\'t conduct proceedings in a court.

Most individuals and businesses will engage a solicitor as their first point of legal contact. \n\n \n\n* Solicitors provide legal advice, manage disputes, and prepare legal documents.\n\n* Barristers are specialists in court advocacy, representing their clients in court.\n\n* An ""IP lawyer"" typically refers to a solicitor who specialises in intellectual property law and may collaborate with a barrister for litigation.\n\nQualifications:\n\n All lawyers must hold a law degree, be admitted to legal practice in an Australian jurisdiction, and maintain a practising certificate. Solicitors and barristers are separately regulated and may also pursue specialist accreditation in IP law. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat they can do (for example but not limited to):\n\n \n\n* Advise you on different areas of IP law, often including infringement, licensing, ownership, commercialisation, and enforcement.\n\n* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.\n\n* Draft and negotiate legally binding agreements such as licences, assignments, confidentiality agreements (also referred to as non-disclosure agreements or NDAs), and terms of use.\n\n* Issue or respond to cease and desist letters relating to potential IP infringement\n\n* Represent you in dispute resolution processes such as negotiation, mediation, and appearances in lower courts.\n\n* Manage the legal aspects of an IP dispute and manage complex or higher court proceedings.\n\n* Help identify and mitigate legal risks associated with creating, using, or enforcing IP.\n\nIt\'s a good idea to ask for an indication of how much the entire process may cost during your first meeting. IP lawyers have a professional obligation to provide you with an upfront estimate of their fees and costs.\n\nWhat they don\'t do:\n\n Lawyers generally do not prepare technical IP specifications unless they are also registered as patent attorneys. Generally speaking, if your legal matter goes to court, solicitors will work with a barrister to represent you in court. \n\nBy engaging an IP professional, they will aim to provide their services to achieve your intended outcome - but they are obliged to follow the instructions you provide them. While they can advise you on certain courses of action, you have the ultimate decision and responsibility.\n\n \n\nWhere to find one:\n\n \n\n \n\nTo find an IP lawyer, you can search on your State or Territory\'s law society website:\u202f\n\n \n\n* Law Institute Victoria\n\n* Law Society Northern Territory\n\n* Queensland Law Society\n\n* The Law Society of NSW\n\n* The Law Society of South Australia\n\n* The Law Society of Tasmania\n\n* The Law Society of the ACT\n\n* The Law Society of Western Australia.\n\nOther IP professionals \n\n \n\nThe term \'IP professionals\' can refer to a wide range of experts and people who can help you plan and manage your business in relation to IP, including those listed above. \n\n \n\nIf you wish to obtain support for other IP-related aspects of your business, you may wish to engage services provided by non-legal IP professionals. While these services can complement a lawyer\'s or IP attorney\'s work, they do not replace legal advice.\n\n \n\n* Commercialisation specialists:Assess commercial potential, align IP with business models, and support licensing or investment readiness.\n\n* Brand consultants:Help position brands and reduce marketplace confusion; they often collaborate with trade mark attorneys and lawyers.\n\n* Franchise and export consultants:Support growth pathways (for example, franchising, overseas expansion) and work alongside legal professionals on agreements.\n\n* IP monitoring services:Track marketplaces, registers and domains and provide alerts about potential conflicts.\n\n* Qualified Persons (QP) for Plant Breeder\'s Rights (PBR):Technically accredit growing trials and certify data for PBR applications.\n\n* IP valuation professionals and IP search firms:Provide specialised reports and searches often used by IP attorneys and lawyers to inform strategy.\n\n* Government business support services:Provide tools and general guidance (for example, IP Australia and business.gov.au); they do not offer individual legal advice.\n\nCommercialisation specialists\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Business professionals who help bring IP-based innovations to market and create commercial value.\n\nQualifications:\n\n May come from backgrounds in business development, commercial law, marketing, or product management. Some are also registered IP attorneys.\n\nWhat they can do:\n\n* Assess the commercial potential of your innovation or IP\n\n* Help develop a business model or pricing strategy\n\n* Identify market entry opportunities or potential customers\n\n* Assist you in preparing for investment pitches, ensuring your IP position supports your commercial story\n\n* Recommend strategies for licensing, joint ventures, or strategic partnerships\n\n* Align IP protection efforts with broader business growth objectives.\n\nWhat they don\'t do:\n\n Cannot offer legal advice unless they are registered lawyers, or file IP rights unless qualified as an IP attorney.\n\n \n\nWhere to find one:\n\n Explore university tech transfer offices, innovation hubs, or search for ""IP commercialisation consultant Australia.""\n\n \n\nBrand consultants\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Branding and communications professionals who support the development, presentation, and positioning of your brand.\n\nQualifications:\n\n May hold qualifications in marketing, design, or business strategy. This profession is not formally regulated.\n\nWhat they can do:\n\n \n\n* Help you understand the business impacts of potential brand infringement, including damaging your reputation, confusion, or weakening of your market presence.\n\n* Support product and service positioning to differentiate from competitors.\n\n* Collaborate with trade mark attorneys or lawyers in developing new IP avoid legal pitfalls in branding.\n\nWhat they don\'t do:\n\n Cannot offer legal advice unless they are registered lawyers, or file IP rights unless qualified as an IP attorney.\n\nWhere to find one:\n\n Use search terms like ""brand strategy consultant Australia"" or visit \n\nAMI\n\n.\n\nFranchise and export consultants\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Business development experts who help extend your IP through franchising or into global markets.\n\nWhat they can do:\n\n \n\n* Provide guidance on structuring a franchise or licensing model using your IP\n\n* Support with export strategies that account for IP registration and enforcement overseas\n\n* Help you understand local market risks and opportunities\n\n* Work with legal professionals to prepare agreements and documents.\n\nWhat they don\'t do:\n\n Cannot offer legal advice unless they are registered lawyers, or file IP rights unless qualified as an IP attorney.\n\n \n\nWhere to find one:\n\n Visit \n\nfranchise.org.au\n\n or for export assistance search ""export consultant Australia.""\n\nIP monitoring services\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Commercial services that track activity across marketplaces, registers, and domains to detect possible infringement.\n\nWhat they can do:\n\n \n\n* Provide alerts about similar IP filings, domain registrations, or suspected counterfeit products. These alerts may be automated, or reviewed by an employee of the monitoring service.\n\n* Monitor online listings and e-commerce platforms.\n\nWhat they don\'t do:\n\n Cannot offer legal advice if they are not registered lawyers, or file IP rights unless qualified as an IP attorney. \n\nSome providers only monitor activity and it\'s up to you to act on their results - and to verify if a discovered use of your IP is likely to be considered infringement. Other providers offer broader services such as investigating suspected infringement, or reporting this to online platforms. These services may be offered by law firms or attorney firms that may be able to offer a package of services beyond standard IP monitoring services. \n\nWhere to find one:\n\n Search ""IP monitoring service Australia"" or ask your IP professional for suggestions.\n\nQualified Persons (QP) for Plant Breeder\'s Rights (PBR)\n\n \n\nWho they are\n\n: Qualified Persons (QPs) are experts accredited by IP Australia in a specific plant group. They are authorised to certify the technical aspects of Plant Breeder\'s Rights (PBR) applications, including supervision and verification of growing trials.\n\nQualifications\n\n: A QP must have recognised expertise in plant breeding or related fields and be formally accredited by IP Australia. Their accreditation enables them to act as official certifiers for PBR applications.\n\nWhat they can do\n\n:\n\n \n\n* Provide advice and guidance throughout the PBR application process\n\n* Design and oversee the growing trial needed to demonstrate that a plant variety is distinct, uniform, and stable (DUS)\n\n* Identify the most appropriate comparator variety of common knowledge (VCK) for the trial\n\n* Submit a pre-trial agreement (PETA) to IP Australia for approval\n\n* Supervise the growing trial to ensure it follows the approved plan\n\n* Collect and analyse trial data to support the application\n\n* Submit a detailed description of the candidate variety through the Interactive Variety Description System (IVDS)\n\n* Organise independent verification of the DUS characteristics by a PBR examiner\n\n* Certify Part 2 of the PBR application, confirming that the trial results support protection.\n\nWhat they don\'t do\n\n: QPs do not provide legal advice or manage the commercial aspects of IP rights. They focus specifically on the scientific and technical certification of PBR trials.\n\nWhere to find one\n\n: You can search the \n\nQualified Person directory\n\n on the \n\nIP Australia website\n\n. When selecting a QP, consider their plant specialisation and location. If no QP is available in your region, you may also apply to become a QP yourself. \n\nIP valuation professionals\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Financial professionals who specialise in determining the value of intangible IP assets. The service can be accessed directly by a business owner, but can be engaged by the professionals listed above who use the outputs as part of broader interpretation, strategy and advice.\n\n \n\n \n\nWhat they can do:\n\n \n\n* Determine the market value of IP rights used to:\n\n* Support fundraising, licensing negotiations, or mergers and acquisitions\n\n* Assist in tax reporting or depreciation of IP assets\n\n* Provide court-admissible reports for IP disputes or damages claims.\n\nWhere to find one:\n\n This is a very specialised area of IP. If you are unsure of your options, you can seek recommendations from other IP professionals. \n\n \n\nIP search firms\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Companies that perform detailed IP searches and competitive landscape assessments. They are often used by other IP professionals on your behalf, who then interpret the discovered IP in terms of their own speciality.\n\nWhat they can do:\n\n \n\n* Search for registered IP rights which may be related to the search query, with experience in searching the right terms and registers.\n\n* Search for evidence which may conflict with proposed rights (e.g. showing \'prior use\' of a trade mark, or evidence that a patent is not \'novel\').\n\n* Monitor IP registers and business sectors for IP conflicts.\n\n* Assist with due diligence during IP acquisition or investment.\n\nWhat they can\'t do:\n\nCannot offer legal advice unless they are registered lawyers, or file IP rights unless qualified as an IP attorney.\n\nWhere to find one:\n\n Use terms like ""IP search firm Australia"" or ask for referrals from your lawyer or IP attorney.\n\n \n\nGovernment business support services\n\n \n\nWho they are:\n\n Federal and state services that offer tools and general IP guidance.\n\n \n\nWhat they can do:\n\n \n\n* Provide IP information and educational resources\n\n* Connect you with advisors or external support\n\n* Offer tools to help you self-assess or manage your IP.\n\nWhat they don\'t do:\n\n Provide legal advice or act on your behalf.\n\nWhere to find one:\n\n Visit \n\nIP Australia\n\n or \n\nbusiness.gov.au\n\n.'}}]}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm?_gl=1*wp2lum*_ga*MTUwOTM4MDc5LjE3MzM3ODMxNTI.*_ga_GMT4KC15KS*MTczNjgxNTEyNS4yNS4xLjE3MzY4MTY5MDEuMC4wLjA.#als_iptags=Trade%20marks&als_e=0', 'name': 'Find an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/benefits-of-engaging-an-attorney', 'name': 'Benefits of using an IP attorney |Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Regulation'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.liv.asn.au/legalhelp', 'name': 'Law Institute Victoria'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://lawsocietynt.asn.au/index.php/nt-law-firms-by-area-of-law/', 'name': 'Law Society Northern Territory'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.youandthelaw.com.au/', 'name': 'Queensland Law Society'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.lawsociety.com.au/register-of-solicitors', 'name': 'The Law Society of NSW'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/PseudoCode/Radius_Search.aspx', 'name': 'The Law Society of South Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.lst.org.au/find-a-lawyer/', 'name': 'The Law Society of Tasmania'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.actlawsociety.asn.au/find-a-lawyer', 'name': 'The Law Society of the ACT'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://lawsocietywa.asn.au/services/find-a-lawyer/', 'name': 'The Law Society of Western Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ami.org.au/', 'name': 'AMI'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.franchise.org.au/', 'name': 'franchise.org.au'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/role-of-a-qualified-person/qualified-persons-directory', 'name': 'Qualified Person directory'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/', 'name': 'IP Australia website'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.business.gov.au/', 'name': 'business.gov.au'}]}"

Do you have IP rights in that country?\nBefore taking action, ensure that you have registered your IP rights in the relevant country. Without local protection, your options for enforcement are limited.\nWhen protecting your IP in Australia, it is a good time to consider filing for protection in other countries as well. When deciding where to seek protection, consider filing in countries where you manufacture products, where you sell or intend to sell, where you may encounter copying risks, or where your competitors are based. The cost of obtaining protection in multiple countries can be significant, so most businesses need to prioritise based on commercial importance and risk.\nFor some IP that requires registration, specifically patents and trade marks, the World Intellectual Property Organisation can facilitate the filing of applications in multiple countries. See \n\nHow to Apply for IP Overseas\n\n for more information.\n2. Different laws and enforcement standards\nEvery country has its own IP laws, registration requirements, court systems, and enforcement practices. What might be viewed as infringement in Australia could be treated differently elsewhere.\nFor example,\n\nthe protection of trade marks can vary significantly. Some countries, like China, Indonesia, or Thailand, follow a first-to-file system, where rights are generally granted to the first person to register the trade mark, regardless of whether they have used it in the market. In Australia, prior use of a trade mark can provide protection and rights, allowing a party that used a mark first to oppose or seek cancellation of a later registration.\nSuch differences can create issues for businesses expanding internationally. Consider a business owner, Sean, who sells branded shoes in Australia under the name 'Voice'. Later, he discovers that someone in China is selling shoes under the same name. Upon further investigation, he finds that this person has registered 'Voice' as a trade mark for shoes in China. Because China operates under a first-to-file system, Sean would likely encounter challenges in contesting the Chinese trade mark registration.\n3. Costs and practical challenges\nOverseas enforcement can involve significant expenses that exceed your expectations. You will likely need to engage local legal representation since foreign lawyers are generally not permitted to appear in the courts of other countries. Translation costs can be substantial, especially in countries where all documents must be officially translated. Foreign legal procedures can be challenging to navigate and may lead to significantly higher legal fees.\n4. Online infringement crosses borders\nThe internet has made the territorial nature of IP rights more complex. A website selling infringing products might be hosted in one country, operated from another, and cater to customers globally. This situation creates practical challenges in determining where to take action. Generally, it's most effective to focus on where the most damage occurs. Consider where your customers or the infringers are located.\nOnline marketplaces present both challenges and opportunities. While infringers can easily reach customers through platforms like Amazon, many of these platforms have established procedures for addressing IP complaints and assist in removing infringing material or listings.""}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Enforcement options?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'When addressing overseas infringement, you have a range of options, each carrying different costs and likelihood of success. Some options include:\nDirect negotiation.\n\nSometimes, a letter of demand from local lawyers can resolve matters without the need for court proceedings. This is often the most cost-effective first step.\nPlatform takedown notices.\n\nMany e-commerce platforms have IP complaint procedures for online infringement, enabling rights holders to request the removal of infringing listings.\nCustoms enforcement.\n\nCountries like Australia allow IP rights holders to register with customs authorities, which enables officials to identify and seize infringing goods at the border. This can be particularly effective for physical products being imported.\nLegal proceedings.\n\nCourt action is appropriate when the infringement is causing significant commercial damage or when other methods have been unsuccessful. Legal proceedings should be a last resort due to their costs, complexity, and uncertainty in foreign legal systems.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Practical tips?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': ""Preventing issues is always better when it comes to international IP protection. Consider filing for protection in key markets early, ideally before launching products or services. While this requires an upfront investment, it's generally far less costly than trying to stop infringement once it has already begun.\nAddressing overseas IP infringement is a complicated and often costly process. Consider consulting an IP lawyer who specialises in international IP protection and enforcement. They can offer specific advice tailored to your situation and help you craft a cost-effective international IP strategy. While it's frustrating to see your IP copied internationally, weigh the costs against the potential benefits carefully. Focus your resources on protecting key markets where enforcement is practical and commercially justified.""}}]}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/international-ip/how-to-apply-for-ip-overseas', 'name': 'How to Apply for IP Overseas'}]}"

The location of the alleged offending might affect how you choose to respond.\nThis page provides an overview of considerations when being accused of infringing overseas.\nDifferent countries have different IP laws. For registered rights, Australian IP registration does not specifically provide protection in overseas markets. It may be possible to infringe someone's IP in an overseas market even if you hold an Australian IP registration or are not infringing anyone else's IP rights in Australia.\nAt a general level, IP infringement considerations can in many jurisdictions be quite similar to those which apply in Australia, and in considering your options may explore matters such as:\n* whether you have engaged in any activities within the relevant overseas market\n\n* whether you have otherwise done any of the things that have been alleged against you\n\n* whether the person making the allegations against you holds the IP rights they say they hold\n\n* whether the things you have done involve infringement of IP rights held by that person (applying the laws of the relevant jurisdiction)\n\n* what would be a good commercial outcome for you in resolving or addressing the allegations made against you\n\n* whether you may be entitled to register your own IP in the relevant country to bolster you position against the other person\n\n* whether you are open to engaging in negotiations, or alternative dispute resolution processes such as mediation, to reach an agreement with the person making allegations against you\n\n* whether you may be prepared to go to court or similar to protect your commercial position regarding the allegations against you\n\n* what the cost implications for any option available to you may be.\nIt is important to understand that the law and legal processes in each jurisdiction will vary around the world. What may not be considered IP infringement in one country, may potentially be in another. Similarly, what makes for a good strategy to address infringement allegations in one country, may not operate in exactly the same way in another.\nThe IP First Response tool provides information about Australian IP law. If you are accused of infringing IP outside of Australia, you may wish to speak to a lawyer who is qualified to advise on the law of that country in which you are being accused of IP infringement.

There are various types of ADR, most notably procedures such as mediation, arbitration and expert determination. These processes typically help resolve disputes through an experienced, impartial person providing opinions, facilitating an agreement between parties and/or providing a binding or non-binding decision.\nYou can also use ADR at any stage of your IP dispute. ADR procedures and services are offered by a wide range of public and private bodies such as courts, tribunals and legal practitioners. Below are most common forms of ADR you may like to consider in resolving your IP dispute.\nMediation\nMediation is a structured negotiation process where the parties, with the assistance of an independent person as mediator:\n* listen to each other and are heard by each other\n\n* identify the disputed issues\n\n* work out what everyone agrees on\n\n* develop options to address the disputed issues\n\n* aim to reach a workable agreement.\nThe mediator has no determinative power to decide the outcome of the dispute - instead, the mediator will assist and advise both parties in shaping the mediation process and facilitating an agreement. Find more information about \n\nmediation\n\n.\nArbitration\nArbitration is a process where you and the other parties present the points being contended and facts to an independent person (the arbitrator). The arbitrator, who is often someone with a high level of expertise in the relevant field of law, then makes a decision based on the information received (an arbitral award). Notable features of arbitration include:\n* A more formal and structured process than other types of ADR, akin to a shorter and more flexible version of a court or tribunal hearing\n\n* The parties are typically expected to produce evidence and submissions before the arbitrator. Both parties must agree before the process commences that the arbitrator's decision will be binding and enforceable\n\n* Parties are in most cases required to renounce all other related legal claims to avoid going to court after arbitral decisions.\nMany contracts stipulate that parties must resolve disputes through arbitration. Arbitration can also be voluntary or required under a court order.\nFind more information about \n\narbitration\n\n.\nExpert determination\nExpert determination is a process where one or more independent experts in the specialist area make a determination on matters referred to them. Expert determination is a highly flexible and collaborative procedure, and its notable features include:\n* The process is initiated by agreement between the parties\n\n* The parties decide the issues that are to be referred to the expert to make a determination on\n\n* The parties need to agree as to whether they want the expert decision to be binding or not\n\n* The parties can select and nominate an expert together\n\n* It is suitable for highly technical issues in a specialist area as the expert would often have a high level of expertise and experience in the relevant industry."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ADR'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}, 'provider': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Qualified Facilitator'}}, {'@type': 'HowTo', 'name': 'How to proceed with resolve conflicts with the help of experienced facilitators\xa0\xa0', 'about': {'@id': '#the-service'}, 'step': [{'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Choose the Right ADR Provider', 'text': ""Before you engage in an ADR process, you should think about what type of ADR process would best suit your needs and find the appropriate ADR provider for the chosen process.

These rights may give you exclusive rights to use or allow others to use your ideas and brand.\nIn practical terms, IP protection can make copying less likely and give you options if you identify possible infringement (sometimes called 'suspected infringement' in legal terms).\nFor a small business, protection can make it safer to invest in new products and marketing. It can also make partnering easier, because other businesses can trust that you control the key assets of the deal. Clear rights can increase business value and help you stand out from look‑alike competitors.\nWhat IP protection may allow you to do includes:\n* Take action to stop others using your brand to sell things without your permission through a registered trade mark.\n\n* Take action to stop others making, using or selling your invention in Australia with a granted patent.\n\n* Take action to stop others using the look of your product with a registered design.\n\n* Control copying, sharing and public use of your creative works under copyright. Copyright protects the way you express an idea, not the idea itself.\n\n* License or sell your IP to create income or expand into new markets.\nSome IP rights come from registration, like registered trade marks, patents and designs. Others arise automatically under the law, like copyright, which protects original creative works from the moment they are created. Unregistered trade marks exist, however they are usually harder to prove and rely on reputation and the Australian Consumer Law. You can seek advice from IP professionals such as IP lawyers, trade mark or patent attorneys to understand what types of IP rights would best protect your business and get help in the registration process.\nIP rights are specific; they cover the goods or services you list, the invention you detail in your application, or the design you register. They also work country by country. If you plan to sell or manufacture overseas, you may need to look at protection in those places too. Systems like the Madrid System (an international system for trade marks) or the Patent Cooperation Treaty (an international system for patents) can help with seeking rights in multiple countries.\nProtection is only part of the picture. Using your brand consistently, keeping good records, and having clear contracts (for employees, contractors and suppliers) can help you keep control. If a contractor or an employee creates something for you, they may own the IP unless your contract says otherwise.\nMonitoring the market can alert you to suspected infringement early, when problems may be easier to resolve.\nA binding determination of infringement comes from a court.\n\n Many issues can be resolved earlier through discussions, online take‑down requests or other dispute resolution options.\nDifferent bodies play different roles. IP Australia examines and registers trade marks, patents, designs and plant breeder's rights, and runs processes like oppositions and hearings which allows people to disagree with IP Australia's decisions. IP Australia does not police or enforce private infringement disputes.\nCourts can decide legal disputes, but there are many ways to deal with legal disputes which avoid going to court. Qualified legal professionals can provide tailored help if you want to explore protection or enforcement options.\nIf holding your edge in business matters - protecting your brand, products and content - exploring IP protection can make it safer to grow your business, and improves the value of your business. You can start small and add more protection as your business and budget grow."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/what-does-ip-protection-mean-my-business'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}}], 'relatedLink': [{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip', 'name': 'Understanding intellectual property (IP) | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/types-of-ip', 'name': 'Types of IP | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/someone-is-using-my-ip', 'name': 'Someone is using my IP | IP Australia'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney#find-an-attorney', 'name': 'How to engage an IP attorney |Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Regulation'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.asbfeo.gov.au/about-us', 'name': 'About us | ASBFEO'}]}"

However, a lot of infringing and counterfeiting activities occur in this space as well, which can undermine legitimate brands and damage their reputation. This can also include selling, reproducing or making available copies of material that is subject to copyright. The 'intermediaries' have a responsibility not to facilitate infringement.\nIf you notice infringement on a website or online platform, you can approach the owners of the site to request that they take down infringing content.

Some platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, invite you to add your trade marks and other kinds of IP rights to a brand registry. This is used in automated checks to detect infringing goods before they are even listed for sale.\nNote:\n\n It can be time-consuming for rights owners to monitor e-commerce platforms and submit IP complaints themselves. A time and cost-effective way to manage this process is often to engage IP professionals such as IP monitoring services. These IP professionals can use their experience and knowledge to identify and remove counterfeit goods across multiple online platforms.\n\n \n\nBeyond online marketplaces, many other digital platforms available to Australian users (including social media platforms to which users can upload content) also offer mechanisms that copyright owners can use to address or prevent infringement. These often include complaint forms and notice and takedown processes that copyright owners can use if they believe their rights have been infringed. They may also include bespoke tools copyright owners can choose use to proactively manage and enforce their rights on those platforms. For example, automated content recognition/identification or screening tools (like YouTube Content ID or Meta Rights Manager) allow copyright owners to upload their content and find matches to content uploaded on platforms by third parties.

Australian law gives creators and inventors legal protection and rights over their work. Australian IP law protects various types of intellectual creations. These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders' rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.\nWhen someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement.\nThink of it as using someone else's property without asking. Just as you would not use someone's car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.\n* Trade mark infringement\n\n* Patent infringement\n\n* Design infringement\n\n* Plant Breeder's Rights (PBR) infringement\n\n* Copyright infringement\n\n* Unregistered trade marks""}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Why ip infringement matters?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': ""IP infringement matters for several reasons:\n* For IP owners:Someone using your IP without permission can damage your business, cost you money, and weaken the value of what you have created.\n\n* For businesses and creators: Using someone else's protected IP without permission can lead to legal disputes, financial penalties, and damage to your reputation.\n\n* For everyone: Australia's IP system tries to balance rewarding creators with allowing new ideas to flourish. Respecting IP rights helps maintain this balance.""}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Key elements of ip infringement?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'While different types of IP have their own specific rules, some common elements help determine if infringement \n\nmight be occurring\n\n:\n1. There must be protected intellectual property\nFor infringement to occur, the creative work or invention must first be protected under the law. This means answering the question, \'What exactly is protected?\' Different rules apply to different types of IP and protect only specific aspects of creation or innovation.\nSome types of IP, like patents, trade marks, and designs, must be officially registered with IP Australia to be protected. On the other hand, IP rights, such as copyright, are automatically protected when certain conditions are met.\nImportantly, IP rights must be in place that have not expired. The various IP rights last for different periods:\n* Patents generally last up to 20 years\n\n* Trade marks can last forever if renewed\n\n* Designs last a maximum of 10 years\n\n* Copyright lasts generally 70 years after the creator dies\n\n* Plant breeders\' rights last up to 20 or 25 years, depending on the plant variety.\n2. Someone used it without permission\nThe person or business must use the protected IP without proper permission (commonly called the alleged infringer). \n\nWithout some form of ""yes, you can use this,"" using protected IP might be considered infringement.\n\n Permission might be granted through:\n* Written agreement allowing its use (called a licence)\n\n* Written agreement to transfer ownership (called an assignment)\n\n* Informal permission (verbal agreement or consent).\n3. What they are using is too similar\nWhen determining infringement, the material created or the activity of the alleged infringer is examined. The alleged infringing material or activity must be sufficiently similar to the protected IP to create a problem. How this is judged under the law depends on the type of IP involved. Different tests are applied to determine what constitutes a problematic level of similarity.\n* For patents: Are they using what a granted patent specifically describes and claims?\n\n* For trade marks: Are they using a trade mark that is too similar and likely to confuse customers, and is it being used on similar goods or services?\n\n* For designs: Does the product look too much like the protected design?\n\n* For copyright: Have they copied a substantial part of the original work?\n\n* For plant breeders\' rights: Have they propagated or copied the protected plant variety?\n4. How it is being used matters\nHow the IP is used is an important factor in determining infringement though the requirements vary by the IP type:\n* Trade marks: To infringe a registered trade mark, someone needs to use something similar to the registered mark to brand or identify their products or services in the marketplace. Mentioning the brand name in conversation or for informational purposes, or in non-commercial contexts, is generally not infringement.\n\n* Designs: Infringement typically involves making, importing, selling, or using products that incorporate the protected design. While often commercial, infringement can occur in non-commercial contexts.\n\n* Patents: Infringement occurs when someone makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports the patented invention without permission.\n\n* Plant breeders\' rights: Infringement is primarily in commercial contexts, involving production, reproduction, conditioning for propagation, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, or stocking of the protected plant variety.\n\n* Copyright: Copyright infringement can occur in both commercial and non-commercial situations. Copying, distributing, performing, or displaying copyrighted works without permission can be infringement.\n5. When using someone\'s IP might be allowed\nEven if someone is using IP in a way that appears to infringe, there may be legal defences or exceptions that allow their use. Each type of IP right has its own defences. Here are some common defences:\n* Trade marks:Using your own name in business is a defence.\n\n* Patents: Using a patented invention for experimental use, like research and testing, is a defence.\n\n* Copyright:Using copyright material for research or study, criticism or review, parody or satire, or news reporting are defences.\n\n* Designs:Making parts needed to repair a complex product is a defence.\n\n* Plant breeders\' rights: Using a plant variety for the purpose of experimentation, further breeding, like cross breeding, or using the variety for private and non-commercial use.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Example scenarios?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': ""Here are some general examples that illustrate potential IP infringement situations:\n* Example 1: A small business develops and uses a logo that closely resembles another cafe's registered trade mark. Even without the intention to copy, this similarity could constitute infringement if it might confuse consumers about the source of the services.\n\n* Example 2: A manufacturer creates a product using a method that incorporates all the essential steps described in someone else's granted patent. This is likely infringement, even if they were unaware of the patent.\n\n* Example 3: A website copies an image from another website without asking for permission.

These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders' rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.\nWhen someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement.\nThink of it as using someone else's property without asking. Just as you would not use someone's car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.\n* Trade mark infringement\n\n* Patent infringement\n\n* Design infringement\n\n* Plant Breeder's Rights (PBR) infringement\n\n* Copyright infringement\n\n* Unregistered trade marks""}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Why ip infringement matters?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': ""IP infringement matters for several reasons:\n* For IP owners:Someone using your IP without permission can damage your business, cost you money, and weaken the value of what you have created.\n\n* For businesses and creators: Using someone else's protected IP without permission can lead to legal disputes, financial penalties, and damage to your reputation.\n\n* For everyone: Australia's IP system tries to balance rewarding creators with allowing new ideas to flourish. Respecting IP rights helps maintain this balance.""}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Key elements of ip infringement?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'While different types of IP have their own specific rules, some common elements help determine if infringement \n\nmight be occurring\n\n:\n1. There must be protected intellectual property\nFor infringement to occur, the creative work or invention must first be protected under the law. This means answering the question, \'What exactly is protected?\' Different rules apply to different types of IP and protect only specific aspects of creation or innovation.\nSome types of IP, like patents, trade marks, and designs, must be officially registered with IP Australia to be protected. On the other hand, IP rights, such as copyright, are automatically protected when certain conditions are met.\nImportantly, IP rights must be in place that have not expired. The various IP rights last for different periods:\n* Patents generally last up to 20 years\n\n* Trade marks can last forever if renewed\n\n* Designs last a maximum of 10 years\n\n* Copyright lasts generally 70 years after the creator dies\n\n* Plant breeders\' rights last up to 20 or 25 years, depending on the plant variety.\n2. Someone used it without permission\nThe person or business must use the protected IP without proper permission (commonly called the alleged infringer). \n\nWithout some form of ""yes, you can use this,"" using protected IP might be considered infringement.\n\n Permission might be granted through:\n* Written agreement allowing its use (called a licence)\n\n* Written agreement to transfer ownership (called an assignment)\n\n* Informal permission (verbal agreement or consent).\n3. What they are using is too similar\nWhen determining infringement, the material created or the activity of the alleged infringer is examined. The alleged infringing material or activity must be sufficiently similar to the protected IP to create a problem. How this is judged under the law depends on the type of IP involved. Different tests are applied to determine what constitutes a problematic level of similarity.\n* For patents: Are they using what a granted patent specifically describes and claims?\n\n* For trade marks: Are they using a trade mark that is too similar and likely to confuse customers, and is it being used on similar goods or services?\n\n* For designs: Does the product look too much like the protected design?\n\n* For copyright: Have they copied a substantial part of the original work?\n\n* For plant breeders\' rights: Have they propagated or copied the protected plant variety?\n4. How it is being used matters\nHow the IP is used is an important factor in determining infringement though the requirements vary by the IP type:\n* Trade marks: To infringe a registered trade mark, someone needs to use something similar to the registered mark to brand or identify their products or services in the marketplace. Mentioning the brand name in conversation or for informational purposes, or in non-commercial contexts, is generally not infringement.\n\n* Designs: Infringement typically involves making, importing, selling, or using products that incorporate the protected design. While often commercial, infringement can occur in non-commercial contexts.\n\n* Patents: Infringement occurs when someone makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports the patented invention without permission.\n\n* Plant breeders\' rights: Infringement is primarily in commercial contexts, involving production, reproduction, conditioning for propagation, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, or stocking of the protected plant variety.\n\n* Copyright: Copyright infringement can occur in both commercial and non-commercial situations. Copying, distributing, performing, or displaying copyrighted works without permission can be infringement.\n5. When using someone\'s IP might be allowed\nEven if someone is using IP in a way that appears to infringe, there may be legal defences or exceptions that allow their use. Each type of IP right has its own defences. Here are some common defences:\n* Trade marks:Using your own name in business is a defence.\n\n* Patents: Using a patented invention for experimental use, like research and testing, is a defence.\n\n* Copyright:Using copyright material for research or study, criticism or review, parody or satire, or news reporting are defences.\n\n* Designs:Making parts needed to repair a complex product is a defence.\n\n* Plant breeders\' rights: Using a plant variety for the purpose of experimentation, further breeding, like cross breeding, or using the variety for private and non-commercial use.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Example scenarios?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': ""Here are some general examples that illustrate potential IP infringement situations:\n* Example 1: A small business develops and uses a logo that closely resembles another cafe's registered trade mark. Even without the intention to copy, this similarity could constitute infringement if it might confuse consumers about the source of the services.\n\n* Example 2: A manufacturer creates a product using a method that incorporates all the essential steps described in someone else's granted patent. This is likely infringement, even if they were unaware of the patent.\n\n* Example 3: A website copies an image from another website without asking for permission.

The registration protects the overall appearance that results from visual features such as shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation applied to a product.\nThe process begins with an online application through \n\nIP Australia's Online Services\n\n. You upload clear drawings (or photographs) of the design, identify the product it is applied to, choose whether to seek registration immediately or defer registration, and pay the application fee. Australia works on a first-to-file basis under the Designs Act 2003, so applying before you disclose the design publicly can be critical. Once the formalities check is complete, the design is registered and published, and a public record is created\nRegistration alone does not give you enforceable rights against suspected infringers. You, or any third party, may later request certification to test whether the design is new and distinctive over earlier designs. Only certified designs can be enforced in court; uncertified registrations provide deterrence but not immediate enforceability. For more information about design certification, please see \n\nRequest Certification for a Registered Design\nA registered design lasts up to ten years: an initial five-year term that can be renewed once for a further five years. A six‑month grace period applies for late renewal after the initial term.\nIf your design has been disclosed to the public before you apply to protect it, you may still be able to secure a design right if you meet the requirements of the grace period. The grace period allows a design to be shared publicly (under certain conditions) without impacting the ability to secure a design right in Australia. It can benefit those who:\n* Accidentally publish their design\n\n* Were unaware they needed to file for protection before disclosure.\nYou'll need to \n\nsubmit your application for a design right within 12 months of disclosing your design\n\n if you want to claim the grace period."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/register-your-right-use-your-design-exclusively'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}, 'serviceOperator': {'@type': 'GovernmentOrganization', 'alternateName': 'Intellectual Property Australia', 'url': 'https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au', 'sameAs': ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Australia', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5973154'], 'name': 'IP Australia'}}, {'@type': 'HowTo', 'name': 'How to proceed with Register your right to use your design exclusively', 'about': {'@id': '#the-service'}, 'step': [{'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Provide detailed visuals', 'text': 'High‑quality drawings (or photographs) that clearly show all views of the design.'}, {'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': ""Enter the product's generic name"", 'text': 'The generic name of the product.'}, {'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Provide ownership proof', 'text': 'Details proving you own the design (for example design brief or commissioning agreement).'}, {'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Create an IP Australia Account', 'text': 'An IP Australia Online Services account and a valid payment method.'}, {'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Allocate fees budget', 'text': 'Budget for application, examination and renewal fees.'}, {'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Seek Professional Advice', 'text': 'Consideration of professional advice before filing.'}, {'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Review registered designs and seek assessment assistance', 'text': 'You may also wish to review other registered designs or seek help to assess the strength of your design right application.'}]}, {'@type': 'FAQPage', 'about': {'@id': '#the-service'}, 'mainEntity': [{'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are the benefits?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '* Registration creates a dated, searchable public record of ownership.\n\n* Registering a design gives you a period within which infringement may occur.\n\n* Exclusive rights may deter competitors and improve negotiating power.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are the risks?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '* Application fees are non-refundable even if the design is later found to be invalid.\n\n* Publication reveals your design to competitors, which may prompt challenges or copying overseas.\n\n* You cannot enforce the right until it is certified, so extra examination fees and time may apply.\n\n* If your claims are unfounded, such as commencing enforcing based on an uncertified design right, alleged infringers may commence legal proceedings for unjustified threats.\n\n* Failing to renew after five years (including the six‑month grace period) will cause the registration to cease and the design enters the public domain.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are the possible outcomes?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '* The design is registered and later certified, giving you enforceable rights.\n\n* The design is registered but never certified, providing a deterrent against its use by others.\n\n* Examination finds the design not new or distinctive and issues are raised.

These prevent someone from gaining a commercial advantage by wrongfully taking the identifying attributes of another\'s business.\n\n1\n1. An action for passing off\nThe common law action of passing off protects the goodwill or reputation associated with an unregistered trade mark. A successful passing off action must prove:\n\n2\n* A business has established goodwill or reputation in a trade mark or another identifying mark in Australia.\n\n* Another business has made a misrepresentation (intentional or not) that is likely to deceive or confuse consumers. For example, consumers are confused thinking that the goods or services come from one business and not the other.\n\n* The business has suffered or is likely to suffer damage as a result.\n\nFor example,\n\na small café called ""Koala Brews"" operates in Brisbane for 15 years, developing strong local recognition in the name. When a new coffee shop opens nearby with a similar name and logo called ""Kola Brews"", causing customer confusion. The original café may have grounds for a passing off action.\n2. Australian Consumer Law (ACL)\nCompetition and Consumer Act 2010\n\n (Cth) prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct and false representations.\n\n3\n\n These provisions can protect unregistered trade marks when:\n* A competitor\'s conduct misleads consumers about the origin of goods or services\n\n* A business falsely claims association, sponsorship, or approval\n\n* A business makes false representations about goods or services.\n\nFor example\n\n, a clothing manufacturer uses a logo that closely resembles that of a well-known Australian designer, leading consumers to believe they are purchasing the designer\'s products.

Given that unregistered trade marks are not filed with IP Australia, experts can help work out what is protected and how it might be misused. Court actions for passing off and ACL violations can be more complex, time-consuming, and costly. Additionally, these actions may also be pursued in conjunction with trade mark infringement cases.

In contrast, there may be no infringement if a similar sign is used for completely different goods or services.\n\n9\nHowever, the law does protect well-known trade marks in some cases.\n\n10\n\n Infringement \n\ncan\n\n occur when a well-known trade mark is used in relation to goods or services unrelated to the registered trade mark.\n\n11'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'How does trade mark infringement happen?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'Where a trade mark is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:\n1. Someone\n\nuses\n\na sign ""as a trade mark""\nThis is a crucial requirement. The infringer must use the sign as a \'badge of origin,\'\n\n12\n\n or in other words, to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services.\n\n13\n\n This involves using the trade mark to identify or differentiate their products or services in the marketplace.\n\n14\n\n This requirement limits infringement and allows for legitimate references to trade marks in contexts that do not suggest commercial origin.\nExamples of use as a trade\n\nmark\n\n:\n* Applying the sign to product packaging or labels15\n\n* Using the sign in advertising to promote goods or services16\n\n* Displaying the sign on business signage or storefronts17\n\n* Using the sign on websites to market products18\nExamples that are not use as a\n\ntrade\n\nmark:\n* Using a word in its ordinary descriptive sense (e.g., using ""apple"" to refer to the fruit)19\n\n* Referring to a trade mark for informational purposes20\n\n* Using a sign purely for functional or decorative purposes21\n2. Someone uses an almost \n\nidentical \n\ntrade mark or one that is similar enough to confuse people\nThis is when someone uses a trade mark that resembles or sounds almost exactly like a registered trade mark,\n\n22\n\n with only tiny differences that would go unnoticed by most consumers.\nFor example,\n\n suppose the word ""KOALA COMFORTS"" is a registered trade mark for bedding products. In that case, using ""KOALA KOMFORTS"" (just changing the spelling) for similar products would likely be considered too similar. Alternatively, someone uses a trade mark that, despite having some differences, is too similar to the registered trade mark. This similarity is likely to confuse consumers about who produces the product or provides the services.\n\n23\n\n For instance, it may look or sound similar enough to a registered trade mark.\nFor example,\n\n if ""BLUE WAVE"" with a wave picture is a registered trade mark for surfboards (see below), using ""BLU WAIVES"" with a similar wave design for surf gear could confuse customers into thinking they are from the same company.\n\nWhen looking at possible trade mark infringement, courts compare the registered trade mark with the alleged infringing trade mark and consider:\n* How similar the trade marks look and sound24\n\n* The impression left by the trade marks25\n\n* Whether the trade marks convey the same idea26\n\n* Where and how the products are sold27\n\n* Whether the typical customer would take the time to notice differences28\n\n* Whether anyone has actually been confused.29\n3. Using the mark on the same or similar goods\n\nor\n\nservices\nLastly, the trade mark is used to sell goods or services that are the same or similar to those listed in the registered trade mark. Therefore, infringement can still occur even when the trade mark is used for goods or services that are not identical to those covered by a registered trade mark but are similar or closely related.\n\n30\nFor example,\n\n if ""SUNNY DAYS"" is registered for coffee, using ""SUNNY DAYS"" for soft drinks might infringe because both products are related to non-alcoholic beverages.\n\n31\n\n Customers might think the same company makes them.\nAgain, courts consider several factors when determining whether goods or services are similar or closely related.\n\n32\nAlternatively, infringement can occur when someone uses a \'well known\' trade mark in relation to goods or services unrelated to those listed in the registration.\n\n33\n\n However, this kind of infringement has not been heard much in court, and its scope is not currently clear.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What is not trade markinfringement?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The \n\nTrade Marks Act 1995\n\n provides several situations where a trade mark is not infringed, including a person who is:\n* using their own name in good faith as a trade mark.34\n\n* just describing the goods or services, or stating where your business is located.35\n\n* indicating the intended purpose of the goods or services (like ""fits iPhone models"").36\n\n* comparing the goods or services to others.37\n\n* using an already registered trade mark.38\n\n* using a trade mark that they could obtain registration for.39\n\n* using a mark that they had before the other mark was registered.40\n\n* re-selling or re-distributing goods that initially used the mark with the owner\'s permission (including parallel imports41'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Understanding theboundariesof protection?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'It is essential to recognise that trade mark protection has limitations. Let\'s say, for example, you register ""SMARTBREW"" for coffee machines\n\n \n\n(listed under class 11) and coffee beans (listed under class 30). Potential infringement situations include:\n* Clear infringement:Another business begins selling coffee machines using the name ""SMARTBREW""The alleged infringing mark is being used as a trade mark (it is on the machine and advertising). The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" are identical. The alleged infringing mark is being used for identical products (coffee machines).\n\n* Possible infringement:Another business starts selling coffee filters using ""STARTBREW"". The business is using ""STARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging). The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" look similar and sound similar. Consumers might be confused about where they came from. The mark is being used on related but not identical goods. Courts would consider how similar these goods are.\n\n* Unlikely to be infringement:A company uses ""SMARTBREW"" for completely unrelated goods like gardening tools. The business is using ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging). The marks are identical, but the company uses the trade mark on goods that differ from the registered trade mark.\n\n* Not infringement:A coffee critique writes a review of the product entitled ""Is SmartBrew worth the money?""The article\'s author is not using the word ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark.\n\n* Not infringement:Another company uses a different coffee-related name, like ""CLEVER COFFEE"", for coffee machines. The business is using ""CLEVER COFFEE"" as a trade mark. However, ""CLEVER COFFEE"" and the registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" are too dissimilar.\nNavigating trade mark infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Additionally, the registered trade mark must be legally valid. A registered trade mark may be challenged in court and sought to be cancelled during a claim of infringement.

Some popular forms of commercial arrangements involving IP include:\nLicensing\nYou can agree to a licensing agreement. Licensing involves the owner of the IP or someone else with a right to licence the IP (the licensor) giving someone else (the licensee) permission to use - but not own - their IP usually in exchange for payment. For detailed information on types of licences and licence conditions, see\u202f\n\nHow To Licence My IP | IP Australia\n\n.\nAssignment (selling or transferring your IP)\nYou may decide to sell your IP as part of your negotiation with the other party. This involves transferring the ownership of the IP to another entity (the assignee) through a process called 'assignment' so that you no longer have the rights to use the IP.\nOnce assignment is completed, you won't have any control over the IP asset you have sold unless you have agreed that the assignee licence some rights back to you. The assignee will bear the risk of commercial development of the IP and be responsible for all costs, including renewal fees paid to IP Australia.\nOnce the title of a registered IP right has been assigned through a contractual agreement, the transfer of the ownership can be recorded on the IP Australia register through IP Australia's\n\nOnline Services portal\n\n.\nFranchising (trade marks)\nIn a franchise agreement, you can give one or more parties (the franchisees) the right to use your trade mark or trade name, your business systems and processes, and so on.\nThe licensed rights are typically used by the franchisees to provide goods or services to agreed specifications. In return, they pay royalties and fees. Franchisees often contribute to marketing costs for the brand as well.\u202fFranchising is a highly regulated area of law and you should consult with a franchising expert such as a franchising lawyer before agreeing to a franchising agreement\n\n.\nLetter of consent or co-existence agreement (trade marks)\nTrade mark owners can negotiate to have their trade marks co-exist in the market. This can allow both parties to use potentially conflicting rights in ways that both agree to (such as in certain geographical areas).\nTrade mark co-existence agreements may take the form a formal contract stipulating rights and obligations of both parties, or a letter of consent where a party gives the other party (often in the form of\n\na letter\n\n) consent to the registration of their right with IP Australia.""}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What might the costs be?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'If you engage an IP lawyer or IP attorney to give you legal advice or act on your behalf, you will have to pay their fees.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'How much time might be involved?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'Commercial negotiation often serves as a cost-effective and non-adversarial way to resolve a dispute with the other party.\nHowever, the amount of time taken to reach an agreeable outcome with the other party will vary depending on the complexity of each case, individual circumstances surrounding each party, and whether the parties choose to engage an IP professional to act on your behalf.'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'How much is this used?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': 'Commercial negotiations are a very common strategy to resolve IP disputes.

If granted, a patent can stop others from making, using, or selling your invention in Australia without your permission.\nPatents are typically used for inventions that are new, useful and involve an inventive step. This could include anything from a physical product to a chemical process, mechanical tool or software-enabled system.\nYou don't need a granted patent to start selling your product, but a patent can strengthen your legal position and give you more control over how your invention is used by others.\nIt is important to note that disclosing your invention can create issues later on for your patent application - if you are considering applying for a patent, it is important to avoid publicly disclosing your invention.\nYou can apply for a standard patent or a provisional application first-each has different costs, benefits and timeframes. Provisional applications are often used as a first step to secure a priority date while you refine your invention or seek investors.\nA provisional application does not offer any patent protection, and simply acts as a placeholder while you decide whether to continue with the patenting process. A provisional application gives you 12 months to consider your options, and most importantly, it establishes your priority date.\nIf you wish to proceed with the application process (and enter the examination stage), you will need to file a standard application. Importantly, you can use the priority date from your provisional application in your standard application. This is of particular value if there is a competitor who has filed a patent application - if they are both directed towards a similar process, you would have a greater chance of being granted the patent owing to your earlier priority date.\nIt is important to note that any features claimed in your standard application must have also been disclosed in your provisional application if you wish to

However, a lot of infringing and counterfeiting activities occur in this space as well, which can undermine legitimate brands and damage their reputation. This can also include selling, reproducing or making available copies of material that is subject to copyright. The 'intermediaries' have a responsibility not to facilitate infringement.\nIf you notice infringement on a website or online platform, you can approach the owners of the site to request that they take down infringing content. To find out who owns a website, you can check their domain name's registration in the\u202f\n\nAustralian\n\n\u202fand\u202f\n\ninternational WHOIS databases\n\n.\nMost e-commerce platforms and major digital advertisers/search engine providers have a notice and take-down mechanism for handling IP complaints, including those concerning counterfeit goods and material that infringes copyright.\nYou can be proactive by listing your IP rights with different e-commerce platforms before anyone tries to sell counterfeit goods. Some platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, invite you to add your trade marks and other kinds of IP rights to a brand registry. This is used in automated checks to detect infringing goods before they are even listed for sale.\nNote:\n\n It can be time-consuming for rights owners to monitor e-commerce platforms and submit IP complaints themselves. A time and cost-effective way to manage this process is often to engage IP professionals such as IP monitoring services. These IP professionals can use their experience and knowledge to identify and remove counterfeit goods across multiple online platforms.\n\n \n\nBeyond online marketplaces, many other digital platforms available to Australian users (including social media platforms to which users can upload content) also offer mechanisms that copyright owners can use to address or prevent infringement. These often include complaint forms and notice and takedown processes that copyright owners can use if they believe their rights have been infringed. They may also include bespoke tools copyright owners can choose use to proactively manage and enforce their rights on those platforms. For example, automated content recognition/identification or screening tools (like YouTube Content ID or Meta Rights Manager) allow copyright owners to upload their content and find matches to content uploaded on platforms by third parties. Where matches are found, copyright owners may be able to seek to pre-emptively block or otherwise monetise the content (for example, through share of advertising revenue in some cases)."", 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/notify-online-marketplaces-infringement-their-platform'}, 'areaServed': {'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Australia'}, 'provider': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'eCommerce provider'}}, {'@type': 'HowTo', 'name': 'How to proceed with Notify online marketplaces of infringement on their platform', 'about': {'@id': '#the-service'}, 'step': [{'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Check multiple platforms', 'text': 'If you have detected infringement on an online platform, it is worth checking several platforms (such as all those listed above) to see if infringement is taking place elsewhere.\nDifferent online platforms have different requirements for making IP complaints and takedown requests.\nYou will usually need:'}, {'@type': 'HowToStep', 'name': 'Collect Infringement Evidence', 'text': 'Evidence such as screenshots, product listings, and any other documentation that clearly demonstrates the infringement.

The model Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) clauses contain the principal elements of a clause to avoid any ambiguity that may later complicate and delay the dispute resolution of a dispute.\nThere are a range of provisions and clauses which can be included in contracts relevant to your situation, which may not be covered by the WIPO Clause Generator. A legal professional can help tailor contacts to reflect your business, the jurisdiction, as well as your preferred resolution options.\nThe WIPO Clause Generator covers common forms of (ADR) offered by WIPO, such as mediation, arbitration, expedited arbitration, and expert determination. These options are often built into commercial contracts to help avoid costly and time-consuming court action. The tool also guides you through standard clause elements - like naming a mediator or arbitrator, identifying their qualifications, setting a preferred location and language, and agreeing how long to wait before escalating to the next step.\nThe generator works for both future contracts (using \n\nmodel clauses\n\n, which set out in advance how any disputes will be handled) and current disputes (using \n\nsubmission agreements\n\n, which allow both parties to agree - after a dispute has already begun - to use WIPO to resolve it). Using the tool may also serve as a prompt for parties to discuss and align their dispute preferences early, creating a clearer path forward if things go wrong later.\nWIPO\n\n is recognised globally as the leading body for resolving IP disputes, and their recommended clauses reflect global standard-practice.

Someone reproduces the copyright work\nReproduction involves some form of copying. To establish infringement, three key elements must be shown:\n* The whole or a ""substantial"" part of the copyright-protected work has been used. Infringement can occur even if a part of it was copied. ""Substantial"" refers to quality rather than quantity. Even a small but important or distinctive part may be substantial. Courts will look at the entirety of the original copyright work and consider whether the quality or essential part of the work was copied.22\n\n* There is a connection between the copyright-protected work and the copied work. Infringement will generally be found if there was access to the copyright work.23Independent creation is unlikely to be an infringement.24\n\n* There is an objective similarity between the original copyright-protected work and the copied work. Courts compare the works to determine if there is an objective similarity. Literal copying is straightforward, but courts may struggle if the similarities are not apparent.25\nCopyright law will automatically consider copying to occur when a\n\n literary, dramatic or musical work has been made into a sound recording or film\n\n26\n\n or converted into digital form.\n\n27\n\n Additionally, an artistic work in two-dimensional form will be infringed if it has been made into three dimensions and vice versa.\n\n28\n2. Someone publishes the work\nInfringement will occur when someone makes something available to the public in Australia that was not previously available.\n\n29\n3. Someone performs the work in public\nInfringement will happen when someone performs the work for members of the public.\n4. Someone communicates the work to the public\nInfringement will occur if someone makes the work available to the public by uploading it to the Internet, for example.\n\n30\n5. Someone copies a sound recording, film or broadcast\nInfringement occurs when someone makes a copy of a sound recording or film and plays or shows it in public.\n\n31'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Common misconceptions about copyright infringement?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '""I changed it by 10%, so it\'s not infringement.""\n\nThere is no percentage rule.

This happens when someone creates more plants of the protected variety. Reproduction here is the act of making more plants by growing seeds or using cuttings.9\n\n* Conditioning the plant material for propagation. This happens when someone prepares the plant materials for growing more plants.10For example, cleaning, coating, sorting, packaging, or grading materials such as seeds, stems, and branches.\n\n* Commercialising of propagating material.

For infringement to happen, the PBR must be legally valid. PBRs can be challenged if, for example, the variety is not new, distinct, uniform and stable (for more information, see \n\nWhat are plant breeder\'s rights\n\n).\n\n26\n\n An expert can also assess the available defences that can affect the outcome.

It might include taking down products or copyrighted content, re-branding, stopping sales, changing your website, or returning stock. A business can decide to stop using the IP completely, or in part. If you are making this change in response to a request or demand from another party, it is important to inform the other party in writing, communicating the actions you have taken or are willing to take in response to their request, to prevent further escalation. You should note that in communicating with the other party, if you admit any fault or liability it will likely assist the other party's legal position against you.\nPlease note: Ceasing use of the contested IP alone may not be sufficient to prevent further escalation. It can also have negative consequences on your ability to respond to allegations of infringement or be seen as an admission of liability.
