The Toyota story: What can SMEs learn from Toyota's approach to counterfeit products?

What can businesses do to protect themselves against importation of counterfeits that might jeopardise their brand and their products? The story of Toyota provides insight into their use of the Australian Border Force's (ABF) Notice of Objection scheme.

The Toyota brand prides itself on having a reputation of quality and reliability among Australian drivers, with its vehicles being a common sight on roads across the country. The company's track record in quality and customer service has helped earn it a loyal customer base, with a market share of 19.5% in Australia and a new sales record in 2024.

However, counterfeit vehicle parts pose a challenge to public safety and to Toyota's brand integrity. According to INTERPOL, counterfeit auto parts--including brake pads, airbags, and filters--are ""often substandard, causing health problems and injuries, even proving fatal. ""

The infiltration of such parts into the Australian market has far-reaching consequences--undermining consumer trust, jeopardising driver safety, and eroding the standards Toyota strives for. That's why Toyota proactively collaborates with the ABF using one of the options open to brands to combat the circulation of counterfeit products.

The role of IP in fighting counterfeits

Intellectual property (IP), particularly trade marks and copyright, plays a critical role for Toyota's in protecting its brand and reputation. The unique Toyota branding, including the word Toyota and its emblem, prevents consumer confusion by ensuring that products bearing the Toyota brand originate from authorised sources and meet Toyota's quality standards. When consumers see the Toyota logo, they know what they are getting.

But when these rights are infringed, the risk extends beyond brand damage. Counterfeit parts that misuse Toyota's branding can deceive consumers and introduce serious safety hazards, particularly when critical components are involved.

IP enforcement is therefore both a commercial and consumer protection priority. It provides the legal basis for identifying and removing fake goods from the market, helping ensure that consumers can have confidence in their purchase of Toyota goods.

Toyota's use of the Notice of Objection scheme

Toyota's journey in protecting its IP rights begins with the detection of infringements. The company actively gathers intelligence on counterfeit products through a range of channels. One of the major sources of detection information comes from the ABF through its Notice of Objection Scheme.

The scheme allows the ABF to engage Toyota's commercial information to identify counterfeit from legitimate products. Toyota's IP assists the ABF in the identification and seizure of counterfeit goods at the point of import, preventing dangerous and unauthorised products from reaching Australian consumers.

The scheme has been particularly useful for:

* Intercepting counterfeit goods at the border and safeguarding consumers from unauthorised imports falsely marketed as ""Toyota"" products, which can potentially compromise consumer safety and the integrity of their vehicles.
* Understanding unlawful importation trends concerning parts and accessories. Without a Notice of Objection in place, Toyota may not be aware of the existence of these products in the market. For example, through a notice of seizure, Toyota became aware of the importation of counterfeit products such as fake airbags and steering wheels.
* Performing testing on product imitation to analyse counterfeit products and understand risks associated with using fake parts. From time to time, Toyota requests a sample of a fake part from the ABF seizure before they are forfeited for physical verification. This verification process allows Toyota to learn more about these fake parts and compare them side by side with genuine Toyota products.
* Obtaining available information from ABF should Toyota commence a legal action -- Toyota may choose to institute a court proceeding against the importer of counterfeit products when the importer makes a claim for release of seized products. However, Toyota is committed to taking genuine steps to resolve disputes before commencing a legal action.

ABF have consistently demonstrated a high level of expertise in identifying and intercepting unlawful goods, allowing Toyota to detect fake ""Toyota"" parts and accessories before they enter the market. However, as outlined above, the benefits of using the Scheme can go beyond physical interception of counterfeit products, providing additional information about trends in unlawful importation, looks and quality of fake products, and identity of the entities involved.

The insights and evaluations obtained from border seizures further enhance the collaborative efforts of Toyota and ABF to identify and prevent counterfeit products from entering the market. For example, Toyota's Brand Protection team has been a regular participant in IP Enforcement Workshops hosted by the ABF in different ports across the country to provide latest information and training on counterfeit products to ABF officers.

However, counterfeit parts are getting increasingly sophisticated. They can look similar in appearance to the genuine products. In some cases, they are indistinguishable to the naked eye. Therefore, other brand protection strategies and mechanisms are implemented by Toyota to assist with a comprehensive approach to brand protection.

One tool among many in the IP enforcement portfolio

When suspected counterfeit products are seized, both the importer and Toyota are notified of the seizure in writing by the ABF. If the importer makes a claim for release of seized goods within ten working days of notification, Toyota will be notified and will also have ten working days to commence a legal action.

However, Toyota aims to adopt a legal, proportionate, and commercially pragmatic approach to their enforcement of their IP. Their enforcement strategy may include:

* Verifying Toyota's IP rights relevant to the alleged infringement
* Legal assessment of the infringing conduct against the legislative framework
* Engaging in correspondence and negotiation with the infringing party's legal representation.

Outcome and finalisation

Toyota's use of the Notice of Objection Scheme shows the way in which businesses can work with the ABF, for a mutually beneficial outcome, to stop counterfeit products entering the Australian market. This mechanism also highlights how IP protection can prevent the circulation of low-quality counterfeit products that might otherwise jeopardise public health and safety.

Toyota's approach also highlights how IP enforcement may involve a range of different options as part of a comprehensive proactive approach to IP.",General

101-2,Infringement 101,What is design infringement?,"Design infringement can occur when someone uses a design that is identical or similar to a registered design without 

obtaining permission from the owner

.

1

 In Australia, a registered design provides designers protection for up to 10 years. Importantly, the law does not require exact copying. If the overall visual impression of the suspected infringing design is substantially similar to the registered design, it may be considered infringement.

2",General
101-2,Infringement 101,What do registered designs protect?,"In Australia, new and distinctive designs are afforded protection with owners registering with IP Australia.

3

 A registered design protects the visual appearance of a product.

4

 The law protects visual features such as shape, configuration, pattern, or ornamentation.

5

 It does not protect how the product works or what it is made from.

6

 Designs are tied to physical products that have a tangible form.

7

 Products must also be manufactured or handmade and are produced on a commercial scale.

8

 For example, the shape of a bottle, the pattern on fabric, or the combined features of shape and patterns on furniture.
Protecting a design involves a two-part process.

 To gain the legal right to take action against someone who uses a design without permission, owners must first register and then certify it with IP Australia. In Australia, this two-part process to apply for a design right is crucial to enforce the right against another person. See more information here '

How to apply for a design right

'.

When it comes to design infringement, it is essential to understand what a registered design protects.
Designs are tied to specific products

. Designs are registered for a particular product (like ""a chair"" or ""a bottle""). Protection only covers the appearance of that product. If someone uses the exact design on a completely different product, this may not be infringement. For example, a chair design is used as a pattern on a t-shirt.
What is shown with the registered design is what is protected

. The images and descriptions of a registered design define what is protected. Registration not only protects the design but also designs that are substantially similar. However, it does not protect every possible variation. Additionally, if a unique feature is not clearly shown or described, it may not be protected.",General
101-2,Infringement 101,How does design infringement happen?,"Where a design is registered and certified with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:
1. Someone

uses

the design
Australian law gives designers exclusive control over their registered designs.

9

 Infringement occurs when a person uses a design that closely resembles a registered design in a way that only the owner is allowed to do so and without permission.

10

 Someone uses a design when:
* Making or offering to make a product with the design11

* Importing a product with the design for sale or business use12

* Selling, hiring, or disposing of a product with the design13

* Using a product with the design for business purposes14

* Keeping a product with the design for sale or business use.15

2. Someone uses a design that is similar to a registered design
Infringement occurs when someone uses a design that looks too similar to a registered design. When looking at possible infringement, courts compare the registered design with the suspected infringing design.

16

 This comparison requires consideration of multiple factors. They consider:
* The overall look. Does the infringing design give the same overall impression as the registered design?17

* Focus on similarities between the designs. Attention is paid to what is similar than what is different.18

* What a familiar person would think. A familiar person is someone who is familiar with the product and similar products.19They consider whether someone familiar with these types of products thinks they look too similar.

* The field for prior designs. If the registered design is more innovative and distinct from existing designs, common features between the design and the infringing design would support a finding of infringement. On the other hand, if the registered design is only slightly different from existing designs, small differences between the registered design and the infringing design support a finding of no infringement.20

* Common features. Features that are common in many similar products are given less importance.21

* Design options. Courts will consider how many different ways a designer could create a design for the product.22

* Statement of Newness and Distinctiveness. A registered design can include a statement that highlights the new and distinctive aspects of a design, helping to focus protection on crucial elements. Comparisons between designs will then focus on these features.23",General
101-2,Infringement 101,Examples of design infringement?,"For example,

 a furniture company registers a design for a distinctive chair 

(Chair A)

with a unique curved backrest and armrests that flow into the seat in one continuous line.

Might be an infringement

: Another company makes a chair 

(Chair B)

 with the same flowing lines from armrests to seat, differing only in size and materials.
Probably not infringement

: Another company makes a chair 

(Chair C)

 with a similar seat but completely different backrest and arms.


For example,

 a soft drink company registers a design for a bottle 

(Bottle A)

 with a distinctive hourglass shape and textured surface.

Might be infringement

: A competitor makes a bottle 

(Bottle B)

 with a very similar hourglass shape and a slightly different but recognisably similar texture.

Probably not infringement

: A competitor makes a bottle 

(Bottle C)

 with a completely different shape but uses a texture that is somewhat similar.",General
101-2,Infringement 101,What is not designinfringement?,"It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The 

Designs Act 2003

 provides several situations where a registered design is not infringed, including:

* Prior use defence. If the suspected infringing design was already being used in Australia before the registered design, the design may continue to be used.24

* Repairs and spare parts:In certain circumstances, using a design to repair a complex product may not be infringement.25This defence recognises the practical need for replacement parts.
Navigating design infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. The scope of protection, the similarity between designs and available defences can all affect the outcome. Additionally, for infringement to occur, the registered design must be legally valid. Registered designs can be re-examined by IP Australia or challenged in court if, for example, it is not new or distinctive. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice.

D1010,Letter of demand,What are the risks?,"* Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation, damages or costs and in you being ordered to stop making the threat.

* Including unreasonably onerous and aggressive terms in your letter (for example, short time frames, demands that do not relate to the IP in question) may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply.

* Exposing yourself to the other party by contacting them might prompt the other party to take actions against you, escalating the conflict in an unwanted way. This could potentially jeopardise your own IP rights.

* For trade marks, it might also prompt the other party to apply for their own trade mark, which may then need to be opposed.

* Sending a letter of demand might give the suspected infringer time to hide or destroy evidence. This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, speak to an IP lawyer before you take any further action.",Risks
D1010,Letter of demand,What are the possible outcomes?,"Sending a letter of demand can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the specific circumstances.
Some possible outcomes are:
* The alleged infringing behaviour stops upon receipt of the letter, especially if the recipient was simply unaware of existing IP rights.

* The alleged infringer does not change their behaviour, in which case you may have to consider other enforcement options.

* Parties can engage in further correspondence disputing part or all of your claims.

* The conflict can further escalate into more serious, formal dispute settlement procedures (that is, litigation, arbitration, administrative hearings).

* The other party may not fulfil all the requirements but may be willing to participate in some form of negotiation.

* The other party may commence proceedings challenging the validity of the IP right, or be prompted to take legal action against you (for instance if they are of the opinion that you are infringing on their rights). This could include seeking damages or compensation for unjustified threatsor an order that you stop making the threat.",General
D1010,Letter of demand,What might the costs be?,"If you engage an IP professional to give you legal advice or draft a letter for you, you will have to pay their fees.
Fees for IP professionals vary depending on the complexity of the issues at hand and which type of IP professional you engage. Fees to draft a letter of demand generally sit between:
* For trade marks: $1,500 to $5,000

* For patents: $1,500 to $10,000
However, you should keep in mind that before drafting a letter of demand, it would be necessary to review relevant materials to confirm whether there is a proper basis for sending the letter of demand, because sending an unjustified threat could expose you to legal action. This means that the fees will also depend on how much work may be required to establish your IP rights and to confirm that there is a proper basis for your suspicion that your IP rights are being infringed by the other party.
Some copyright owners could explore avenues for accessing low- or no-cost legal advice. For example:

101-3,Infringement 101,What is patent infringement?,"Patent infringement can occur when someone uses an invention protected by another person's patent without obtaining permission first. In Australia, granted patents give inventors the ability to control the use of their invention for up to 20 years (or up to 25 years for 

pharmaceutical

 patents).",General
101-3,Infringement 101,What does a granted patent protect?,"When considering patent infringement, it is essential to understand what a granted patent protects. A patent protects any device, substance, method or process that's new, inventive and useful.

1 

A granted patent provides its owner with exclusive control over the invention. A patent protects the specific invention described and claimed in the patent document. This can include the particular way something is made, how it works or the specific process for doing something.
For example,

 the Cochlear implant (a device) and polymer (plastic) bank notes (a substance) are inventions that have been protected with granted patents.
The most important part of a patent document is the statement of claims, which defines exactly what the inventor is legally protecting. A patent may contain multiple claims, each of which must be directed towards the same invention. Patent claims are written clearly and concisely to define what the invention is and what it is not. Therefore, the claims set out the boundaries of what others are not allowed to copy without the owner's permission. For infringement to take place, a person must do or produce something that is specified in one or more of the patent claims.
When someone receives a granted patent in Australia, they are given legal rights to their invention for a specified period. These rights include the right to stop others from using their invention without permission.",General
101-3,Infringement 101,How does patent infringement happen?,"Where a patent is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:
1. Someone uses the patented invention
Australian patent law gives inventors exclusive control over their patented inventions. Infringement occurs when a person uses a patented invention in a manner that only the owner is allowed to do so without permission.

2

 It can happen in two ways:
When someone directly uses the patented invention.

Use happens when someone:
* Makes or manufactures a product that uses the patented invention

* Uses the patented method or process

* Sells, offers to sell, or brings into Australia a product that uses the patented invention

* Uses a product that was made using the patented process.
When someone helps another to infringe the patent.

This happens when someone supplies products to another person, knowing they will use those products to infringe a patent.

3
2. Someone uses an invention covered by the patent
Infringement occurs when someone does something or produces something that includes 

all the features mentioned in one or more of the claims in the patent. 

To work out whether patent infringement has occurred, courts look at:
* What exactly is protected? They first look at the ""claims"" section of the patent. Claims are typically located at the end of a patent document and contain numbered statements that describe precisely which parts of the invention are protected.

* Compare with the suspected product or process. Courts examine whether the product or process includes all the essential elements described in at least one of the patent claims.

* Consider variations. Even if a product is not exactly the same as what is described in the patent, it may still infringe.4For example, if someonesubstitutes an inessential part with another, that is equivalent.",General
101-3,Infringement 101,Examples of patent infringement?,"Acme Inc. holds a patent for a new type of solar panel that uses a specific arrangement of materials to improve efficiency. Acme has a patent granted by IP Australia. CompetitorTech begins manufacturing and selling solar panels in Australia that use the exact same arrangement of materials as described in Acme's patent claims. This is likely a direct infringement, as CompetitorTech is making and selling a product that contains all the elements of Acme's patent claims.
Hanka Robotics holds a patent for a mechanical device comprising components A, B, C, and D arranged in a specific way. RivalCorp produces a similar device using components A, B, and C. However, it includes a modified version of D that performs the same mechanical function. Even though RivalCorp's device doesn't exactly match the patent claims, it may still infringe because it performs the same function in the same way.

5",General
101-3,Infringement 101,What is not patentinfringement?,"It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The 

Patents Act 1990

 provides several situations where a patent is not infringed, including:
* Prior use. A person will not be infringing a patent if they were using the invention before the patent was filed.6

* Foreign vehicles passing through. Using a patented invention on foreign ships, aircraft, or vehicles that are only temporarily in Australia does not count as infringement. So long as the invention is used only for the vehicle's own needs.7

* Obtaining regulatory approvals. A person will not be infringing a patent if they are using the patented invention to obtain approval for medical goods with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)8or other regulatory approval for non-pharmaceutical goods (e.g., agricultural chemicals).9

* Experimental use. A person will not infringe a patent if they are experimenting with the invention,10such as determining the properties of the invention, the legal scope of protection for the invention, improving or modifying the invention, assessing the legality of the patent, or evaluating whether the patent has been infringed.11
Navigating patent infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Experts can help work out exactly what a patent protects. They can interpret the legal language in the patent claims. Additionally, for infringement to happen, the patent must be legally valid. Patents can be challenged if, for example, the invention is not new or innovative. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

* Potentially lower costs and a quicker process, especially compared to other dispute resolution processes where you must rely on third parties (such as courts and tribunals).

* The ability to agree to a creative, productive outcome that can benefit both parties commercially.

* A much less adversarial pathway than legal procedures, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party.

* A flexible and informal approach, as it is entirely up to the parties to shape the process.

* Negotiation can be conducted across multiple jurisdictions.

* Confidentiality, as the details of negotiation and the resulting agreements reached are generally not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.",Benefits
B1014,Negotiation,What are the risks?,"* Relies on genuine engagement and willingness of parties to resolve issues.

* If the discussion stalls or backfires, this could result in delays or lost opportunities.

* Outcomes may not be as easily enforceable as court or tribunal decisions, especially when parties have not clearly indicated that the outcome of the negotiation is to be legally binding.

* In some cases, direct contact may worsen tensions. If the other party considers that you are posing unreasonable aggressive or unprofessional terms for negotiation (not negotiating in good faith), it may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply. Some commercial arrangements may result in your intellectual property being 'diluted' by sharing the same or similar IP with others, which may cause damage to the value of your IP and make it harder to enforce it in the future.

* If not handled with caution, it is possible that you may say something that undermines your legal position, which could result in less favourable outcomes if formal action follows.",Risks
B1014,Negotiation,What are the possible outcomes?,"Commercial negotiations can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the parties' desires and specific circumstances. If you are able to reach an agreed outcome, this might result in:
* A licence or co-existence arrangement,

* Selling or transferring IP ownership (calledassignment),

* Compensation or goodwill payment,

* Franchising options, or

* Mutual agreement to stop or change the disputed conduct.

* Hearing officers in IP Australia have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.

* The process is accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.

* The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.

* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.",Benefits
D1016,Opposition process,What are the risks?,"* If your opposition is unsuccessful and the trade mark proceeds to registration, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.

* When opposing the registration of a trade mark, the applicant will be notified of your opposition. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the other party be aware of your actions.

* Due to the public nature of these procedures there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to take an enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy.

* There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.

* Using these procedures improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.

* If you are successful in opposing registration of a trade mark, the denied applicant may appeal the decision to court.

Dxxxx,,What are the risks?,"* Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation, damages or costs and in you being ordered to stop making the threat.

* Including unreasonably onerous and aggressive terms in your letter (for example, short time frames, demands that do not relate to the IP in question) may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply.

* Exposing yourself to the other party by contacting them might prompt the other party to take actions against you, escalating the conflict in an unwanted way. This could potentially jeopardise your own IP rights.

* For trade marks, it might also prompt the other party to apply for their own trade mark, which may then need to be opposed.

* Sending a letter of demand might give the suspected infringer time to hide or destroy evidence. This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, speak to an IP lawyer before you take any further action.",Risks

Some possible outcomes are:
* The alleged infringing behaviour stops upon receipt of the letter, especially if the recipient was simply unaware of existing IP rights.

* The alleged infringer does not change their behaviour, in which case you may have to consider other enforcement options.

* Parties can engage in further correspondence disputing part or all of your claims.

* The conflict can further escalate into more serious, formal dispute settlement procedures (that is, litigation, arbitration, administrative hearings).

* The other party may not fulfil all the requirements but may be willing to participate in some form of negotiation.

* The other party may commence proceedings challenging the validity of the IP right, or be prompted to take legal action against you (for instance if they are of the opinion that you are infringing on their rights). This could include seeking damages or compensation for unjustified threatsor an order that you stop making the threat.",General
Dxxxx,,What might the costs be?,"If you engage an IP professional to give you legal advice or draft a letter for you, you will have to pay their fees.

* For trade marks: $1,500 to $5,000

* For patents: $1,500 to $10,000
However, you should keep in mind that before drafting a letter of demand, it would be necessary to review relevant materials to confirm whether there is a proper basis for sending the letter of demand, because sending an unjustified threat could expose you to legal action. This means that the fees will also depend on how much work may be required to establish your IP rights and to confirm that there is a proper basis for your suspicion that your IP rights are being infringed by the other party.

Some useful starting points include theTrans-Tasman IP Attorney registryand theABN lookup tool.

* Description of the alleged infringement- Explains which IP rights are involved (for example trade marknumber, patent number, specific item of copyright material and so on), identifies the sender's ownership of the right (or if they do not own the right themselves, it identifies the other basis on which they make the claim - for example if they have an exclusive license) and what actions you took that the sender claims infringe their IP rights.

* Demand to stop the activity- Usually includes a list of things that the sender wants you to do in response to their letter, such as taking something down from a website, stopping selling a product, changing branding or marketing, or paying them compensation.

* Deadline for compliance- Often includes a time limit for responding to their demands (for example, from 7 to 30 days) after which they may decide to start legal action against you.

* Evidence or exhibits- May include screenshots, photos, links or documents.

* Consequences of non-compliance- Often warns of possible court action, damages or injunctions. This is a common inclusion but doesn't mean legal action will immediately or definitely follow.

101-8,Infringement 101,What is trade markinfringement?,"Trade mark infringement can occur when someone uses a brand name, logo, slogan, or another identifying mark that is too similar to someone else's registered trade mark,

1 

particularly if it is for the same or similar goods or services.

2

 

This can lead to confusion among consumers about the source of the goods or services being offered.
In Australia, there are laws protecting registered trade marks (specifically the 

Trade Marks Act 1995

 (Cth)). A registered trade mark gives its owners the exclusive right to use the trade mark in Australia and the ability to stop others from using the trade marks without permission.

3",General
101-8,Infringement 101,What is protected under a registered trade mark?,"Understanding what a registered trade mark protects is essential to identifying infringement.

4

 A trade mark registered with IP Australia gives its owner exclusive rights based on two key components:

5
* The sign itself- the word, logo, phrase, or other trade mark registered (seeKinds of Trade Marksfor more information).6

* The goods and services- those listed in the registration (seeClasses of Goods and Servicesfor more information).7
Protection is generally limited to these combined elements.

8

 For example, a person will infringe a registered trade mark if they use a similar trade mark with the same or similar goods or services listed in the registration. In contrast, there may be no infringement if a similar sign is used for completely different goods or services.

9
However, the law does protect well-known trade marks in some cases.

10

 Infringement 

can

 occur when a well-known trade mark is used in relation to goods or services unrelated to the registered trade mark.

11",General
101-8,Infringement 101,How does trade mark infringement happen?,"Where a trade mark is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:
1. Someone

uses

a sign ""as a trade mark""
This is a crucial requirement. The infringer must use the sign as a 'badge of origin,'

12

 or in other words, to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services.

13

 This involves using the trade mark to identify or differentiate their products or services in the marketplace.

14

 This requirement limits infringement and allows for legitimate references to trade marks in contexts that do not suggest commercial origin.
Examples of use as a trade

mark

:
* Applying the sign to product packaging or labels15

* Using the sign in advertising to promote goods or services16

* Displaying the sign on business signage or storefronts17

* Using the sign on websites to market products18
Examples that are not use as a

trade

mark:
* Using a word in its ordinary descriptive sense (e.g., using ""apple"" to refer to the fruit)19

* Referring to a trade mark for informational purposes20

* Using a sign purely for functional or decorative purposes21
2. Someone uses an almost 

identical 

trade mark or one that is similar enough to confuse people
This is when someone uses a trade mark that resembles or sounds almost exactly like a registered trade mark,

22

 with only tiny differences that would go unnoticed by most consumers.
For example,

 suppose the word ""KOALA COMFORTS"" is a registered trade mark for bedding products. In that case, using ""KOALA KOMFORTS"" (just changing the spelling) for similar products would likely be considered too similar. Alternatively, someone uses a trade mark that, despite having some differences, is too similar to the registered trade mark. This similarity is likely to confuse consumers about who produces the product or provides the services.

23

 For instance, it may look or sound similar enough to a registered trade mark.
For example,

 if ""BLUE WAVE"" with a wave picture is a registered trade mark for surfboards (see below), using ""BLU WAIVES"" with a similar wave design for surf gear could confuse customers into thinking they are from the same company.

When looking at possible trade mark infringement, courts compare the registered trade mark with the alleged infringing trade mark and consider:
* How similar the trade marks look and sound24

* The impression left by the trade marks25

* Whether the trade marks convey the same idea26

* Where and how the products are sold27

* Whether the typical customer would take the time to notice differences28

* Whether anyone has actually been confused.29
3. Using the mark on the same or similar goods

or

services
Lastly, the trade mark is used to sell goods or services that are the same or similar to those listed in the registered trade mark. Therefore, infringement can still occur even when the trade mark is used for goods or services that are not identical to those covered by a registered trade mark but are similar or closely related.

30
For example,

 if ""SUNNY DAYS"" is registered for coffee, using ""SUNNY DAYS"" for soft drinks might infringe because both products are related to non-alcoholic beverages.

31

 Customers might think the same company makes them.
Again, courts consider several factors when determining whether goods or services are similar or closely related.

32
Alternatively, infringement can occur when someone uses a 'well known' trade mark in relation to goods or services unrelated to those listed in the registration.

33

 However, this kind of infringement has not been heard much in court, and its scope is not currently clear.",General
101-8,Infringement 101,What is not trade markinfringement?,"It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The 

Trade Marks Act 1995

 provides several situations where a trade mark is not infringed, including a person who is:
* using their own name in good faith as a trade mark.34

* just describing the goods or services, or stating where your business is located.35

* indicating the intended purpose of the goods or services (like ""fits iPhone models"").36

* comparing the goods or services to others.37

* using an already registered trade mark.38

* using a trade mark that they could obtain registration for.39

* using a mark that they had before the other mark was registered.40

* re-selling or re-distributing goods that initially used the mark with the owner's permission (including parallel imports41",General
101-8,Infringement 101,Understanding theboundariesof protection?,"It is essential to recognise that trade mark protection has limitations. Let's say, for example, you register ""SMARTBREW"" for coffee machines

 

(listed under class 11) and coffee beans (listed under class 30). Potential infringement situations include:
* Clear infringement:Another business begins selling coffee machines using the name ""SMARTBREW""The alleged infringing mark is being used as a trade mark (it is on the machine and advertising). The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" are identical. The alleged infringing mark is being used for identical products (coffee machines).

* Possible infringement:Another business starts selling coffee filters using ""STARTBREW"". The business is using ""STARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging). The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" look similar and sound similar. Consumers might be confused about where they came from. The mark is being used on related but not identical goods. Courts would consider how similar these goods are.

* Unlikely to be infringement:A company uses ""SMARTBREW"" for completely unrelated goods like gardening tools. The business is using ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging). The marks are identical, but the company uses the trade mark on goods that differ from the registered trade mark.

* Not infringement:A coffee critique writes a review of the product entitled ""Is SmartBrew worth the money?""The article's author is not using the word ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark.

* Not infringement:Another company uses a different coffee-related name, like ""CLEVER COFFEE"", for coffee machines. The business is using ""CLEVER COFFEE"" as a trade mark. However, ""CLEVER COFFEE"" and the registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" are too dissimilar.
Navigating trade mark infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Additionally, the registered trade mark must be legally valid. A registered trade mark may be challenged in court and sought to be cancelled during a claim of infringement. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

101-1,Infringement 101,How to avoid infringing others' intellectual property?,"Running a business or developing new products or services often means creating intellectual property (IP) or encountering IP rights owned by others. Whether it is a brand name, invention, design, or creative work, using something similar to someone else's existing intellectual property may be considered infringement.
An IP owner may contact you informally, seeking an amicable resolution, or formally, with a letter from a lawyer demanding that the infringement stop. Alternatively, IP owners might initiate legal action, requesting a court to stop you from using a brand, design, or technology, or to compel you to pay damages to the IP owner. In some instances, you may be required to destroy products or marketing materials.
It is crucial to understand that you can infringe on someone's IP rights without even knowing those rights exist. While you might not have to pay monetary compensation (called damages) to the IP owner if you genuinely had no reason to believe the IP existed, you can still be ordered to stop using the IP.
Understanding how to avoid infringing on others' rights from the beginning can save your business from serious consequences. With awareness and careful planning, you can minimise the risk of infringing on others' intellectual property rights.",General
101-1,Infringement 101,Avoiding ip infringement?,"1. Conduct searches before you invest
One of the most effective ways to avoid IP infringement is to check for existing rights before committing to a new venture. For example, before launching a new product, brand, or service, you should search the Australian trade mark register using IP Australia's 

Australian Trade Mark Search

, check design registers for similar registered designs through the 

Australian Design Search

, check plant varieties on 

the Australian PBR Search,

 and search patents on 

the Australian Patent Search

 if you are developing new technology.
However, not all intellectual property is registered with IP Australia. For instance, individuals are not required to register their copyright in original creative works. In this case, start by cataloguing all the content you plan to use. Such material can include text, images, videos, music, and graphics. Knowing precisely what you have will simplify your search. After that, conduct a quick online search for key phrases or images in your work. Using reverse image search tools (such as Google Images or TinEye) can help identify copied visuals. For text, paste sections into a search engine or utilise plagiarism checkers (such as Turnitin or Grammarly).
By searching first, you can avoid unintentionally infringing on others' intellectual property rights.
For example,

 a Melbourne café owner wanted to name their business ""The Daily Grind"". A quick trade mark search revealed several similar registered marks in the food services class, prompting them to choose a different name before investing in signage and marketing.
2. Create original work
The safest way to avoid infringement is to create original content. This approach applies to brand names and logos, product designs, marketing materials, website content, and product packaging. By creating something original, you not only avoid infringing on others' rights but also build valuable IP assets.
For example,

instead of copying a competitor's product packaging, a small cosmetics company hired a graphic designer to develop distinct packaging that reflected their brand values while avoiding existing designs.
3. Understand what you can and cannot use
Not all uses of others' IP require permission. Australian law permits specific uses without the IP owner's consent. For instance, under copyright law, 'fair dealing' exceptions allow limited use of copyright material for particular purposes, such as research, criticism, or parody.
You can also use IP where the rights have expired. However, be cautious, as some rights may still be eligible for renewal.
4. Get permission when needed
Obtaining proper permission is essential if you want to use someone else's IP. This means securing a written agreement (often called a licence) that outlines what you can and cannot do with the IP. A verbal agreement or an email may seem sufficient at the time, but written documentation safeguards both parties and prevents future misunderstandings.
It is a good idea to maintain thorough records of all permissions granted, understand any limitations on the use of the IP, and consider obtaining professional legal advice for complex arrangements.
5. Be cautious with online content
The internet can create a false sense that content is freely available for use. However, just because something appears online does not mean it is free to use, and do not assume that attribution alone makes copying acceptable. Images, text, and videos are typically protected by copyright from the moment they are created. Company names and logos are often registered trade marks, and product designs may be protected by registered design rights. Always search IP databases and seek licences before using online content.",General
101-1,Infringement 101,Red flags to watch for?,"Specific situations should prompt extra caution in your IP practices. For instance, exercise particular care if you find yourself:
* closely copying a competitor's successful product or brand,

* using material that you have found online,

* modifying someone else's work slightly and claiming it as your own, or

* importing products without checking Australian IP rights.
These scenarios frequently lead to infringement disputes and should prompt you to seek advice before proceeding.",General
101-1,Infringement 101,When to seek help?,"Professional advice is especially valuable in specific situations. Seeking early professional guidance often costs much less than defending against an infringement claim later. Consider speaking with an IP professional when:
* Search resultsreveal similar existing rights to those you plan to use.

* You are developing products for highly competitive markets.

* You receive a letter of demand or a 'cease and desist' letter.",General
B1009,Patent Re-Examination ,What are the benefits?,"A patent re-examination provides a relatively affordable and expedient means of challenging the validity of a patent.
The re-examination process also allows for the submission of documents and supporting evidence from the challenging party, including citations which may not have been considered when the patent was examined.
One additional benefit of the re-examination process, is that it operates independently of the court system, meaning that it will not prejudice any subsequent litigation (i.e. it won't influence a judge in a court case). Note that re-examination decisions may be appealed to the Federal Court.",Benefits
B1009,Patent Re-Examination ,What are the risks?,"There are some risks associated with the patent re-examination process.
While the costs associated with a re-examination request are low, there is still the possibility that the challenging party will not be successful, and the patent will be maintained. Notably, the re-examination process also allows the patent holder to amend their claims; in some cases, allowing them to circumvent the grounds on which the patent was challenged.
Another significant risk associated with re-examination, is that the process is '

ex parte'

, meaning that after the initial submissions to the Patent Office, the challenging party is not involved in the proceedings at all. As such, if the outcome of the re-examination is not in favour of the challenging party, they have few options to refute the outcome (although, another re-examination can be 

requested

).
Requesting a re-examination will also inform the other party of your request, potentially harming professional relationships and increasing the possibility that the other party may act more defensively or even contest your own rights.",Risks
B1009,Patent Re-Examination ,What are the possible outcomes?,"There are 4 possible outcomes from the patent re-examination process:
* The patent is upheld in its original form

* The patent is upheld in an amended form

* The patent is revoked

* In rare cases, IP Australia may not consider the re-examination request reasonable and refuse to re-examine the case.
If the challenging party remains unsatisfied, they are able escalate to invalidity proceedings in court (at significantly higher cost).",General

Additionally, if you have an attorney acting on your behalf, you may be liable for additional legal fees.",Costs
B1009,Patent Re-Examination ,How might time might be involved?,"A re-examination report will be provided within 8 weeks from receiving the first response. In cases where the initial re-examination report is adverse (i.e. that the patent should not have been granted), the patentee may amend the claims, and subsequent reports may be issued, this may take significantly longer (typically 4-6 months).",Time

D1018,Court - Patent,What are the benefits?,"* If you succeed, a court may award damages or compensation to cover various losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made by the infringer through their infringement).

* Court decisions are binding and enforceable.

* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.

* You can resolve several related matters in one case including claims of infringement, patent validity challenges and other related legal claims.

* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.

* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.

* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage parties to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid court proceedings continuing.

* For infringement claims, a court can in appropriate situations make orders to prevent the infringer from continuing to infringe your IP rights.",Benefits
D1018,Court - Patent,What are the risks?,"* The outcome can be unpredictable.

* While a court can determine matters of law, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.

* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you.

* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties if you are wholly (or partially) unsuccessful.

* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you.

* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful and time-consuming and distract from the operation of your business.

* Court proceedings are usually public, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.

* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.

* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.

* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).

* You may not be able to bring a legal claim if you have agreed in a contract that you will use, or that you will first try, an alternative form of dispute resolution.",Risks
D1018,Court - Patent,What are the possible outcomes?,"The possible outcomes vary depending on the type of litigation.
It is possible you may reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.
For revocation proceedings, a court might order that a patent be:
* revoked in whole or in part

* amended in whole or in part

* upheld in whole or in part.
It is also possible to have a mixed result. For example, if some of the claims in a patent are challenged, one claim might be upheld and the other claim might be revoked.
For infringement proceedings:
* A court might temporarily order the alleged infringer to stop any alleged infringement until a final decision is made - seeSeek an urgent injunction

* If you're successful in infringement proceedings, a court might order:that you be paid damages or compensationthat the other party or parties pay some or all of your legal coststhe infringer not to infringe your IP rights in future.

* If you're unsuccessful in infringement proceedings, a court might order:that you pay some or all of the legal costs for the other party or parties.
Again, it is possible to have a mixed result. For example, a court might agree that some of the other party's conduct infringes your patent, but that other conduct does not.
Courts also have powers to make other types of orders as part of the outcome.
You or the other party or parties may be able to appeal the decision.",General
D1018,Court - Patent,What might the costs be?,"While simple patent-related litigation may cost 

between $100-500k

, major patent litigation can cost in the millions. Appeals cost anywhere from $150k-300k+.
Legal representation typically makes up a large proportion of these costs.",Costs
D1018,Court - Patent,How much time might be involved?,"Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, and which court hears your claim.
Patent cases are typically heard by the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed 

intellectual property

 as the cause of action, were as follows

:

;
* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months

* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months

* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1
If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.
Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.
Time limits for starting legal claims
There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start. Due to the complexities, it may be helpful to speak to an IP lawyer about time limits.",Time

D1017,Patent opposition,What are the benefits?,"Patent oppositions provide a moderately cost-effective mechanism to challenge the validity of an Australian patent application. Additionally, the oppositions process is adversarial, meaning that you will have the opportunity to provide evidence and refute or reply to evidence provided by the opposition regarding the legal and/or factual arguments directed against the patent.
Additionally, the oppositions process takes place prior to the grant of the patent, potentially reducing the risk of commercial disputes arising from the grant of the patent.",Benefits
D1017,Patent opposition,What are the risks?,"* If your opposition action is unsuccessful and the patent is granted, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.

* When opposing the acceptance of a patent, the applicant will be informed of your opposition, as well as any documents or evidence provided (unless you notify IP Australia of the confidentiality requirement for some or all of the documents). You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the applicant be aware of you and access these materials.

* It is possible that filing an opposition may alert the other party to your claims and can cause them to act more defensively or even contest your own rights.

* Using this process improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.

* If you are late in providing evidence which you promised, late fees may be owed to IP Australia.",Risks

* Maintaining control through terms and restrictions in the agreement.

* Licences are incredibly flexible - you can choose what, where, when and how IP can be used.",Benefits
C1007,IP Licensing,What are the risks?,"Licensing your IP also comes with potential risks:
* Disputes can arise if the terms of the licence are not clear. Getting an IP professional to draft the licence can help to reduce this risk.

* You may need to monitor the licence agreement to ensure the other party complies with it.

* Licensing your IP rights to others has the potential to reduce the uniqueness or value of your IP depending on the circumstances, including who you license it to and the licensing terms.

* If youexclusivelylicense your IP rights, you will no longer be able to use them yourself.

* In specific instances regarding trade marks, if the licensor is unable to maintain effective controls over trade mark use, the trade mark can become vulnerable to removal for non-use.

* In the case a patent has been licensed to an exclusive licensee - they will have the right to commence infringement proceedings. In some cases, the patent holder can also be added as a party to those proceedings, potentially leading to legal action or expense.

* If you do not put in place arrangements to protect your sensitive commercial information (such as specific business practices or product features) during negotiations, it may be shared with other parties or misused by the recipient.

Legal professionals
If you are seeking advice on how to enforce or defend your IP rights, and what actions might be most appropriate for your situation, speak to a lawyer or other relevant legal professional. We use the term 'legal professional' to refer to professionals who aren't necessarily lawyers, such as IP attorneys. IP attorneys (registered patent or trade mark attorneys) are not necessarily lawyers, but they are qualified to provide information about protecting IP.
Many IP lawyers and IP attorneys have specialties relating to particular industries or situations, and may be more effective in their particular field of expertise. For instance, some IP lawyers may specialise and be highly experienced in dealing with trade marks, but less experienced with patents.

Both an IP lawyer or IP attorney can provide you with advice and act for you at different stages of IP protection and enforcement. Read below to consider which is most appropriate for your needs.

Trade mark attorneys

 

Who they are:

 Specialists in trade marks who focus on obtaining and maintaining registered IP rights to protect brands (names, logos, slogans) and support business growth.

Professional standards:

Attorneys must be registered with the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board. They are required to complete ongoing education, and are bound by strict professional and ethical standards.

How they can help (for example):

* Advise whether a brand is registrable and run clearance searches to identify conflicts.

* Prepare and lodge trade mark applications in Australia and some other countries; manage renewals and ownership changes.

* Help respond to objections and file oppositions with IP Australia in relation to trade mark applications.

* Advise on brand strategy and related IP options where appropriate.

* Monitor competitors and support steps to enforce rights.

* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.

* Assist with licensing.

* Advise on possible infringement risks relating to others' rights.

What they don't do:

 

 

A trade mark attorney cannot provide general legal advice and can't conduct proceedings in a court. If you engage an IP attorney, they would need to refer you to a lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.

Where to find one:

 

 

You can find a qualified IP attorney to assist you on the Trans-Tasman Attorneys Board website:

IP lawyers (including solicitors and barristers)

 

Who they are:

 Lawyers who specialise in IP law, which for some is regarded a distinct area of legal practice involving a focus on IP rights matters.

 

In Australia, ""lawyer"" is a broad term that includes both solicitors and barristers. Most individuals and businesses will engage a solicitor as their first point of legal contact. 

 

* Solicitors provide legal advice, manage disputes, and prepare legal documents.

* Barristers are specialists in court advocacy, representing their clients in court.

* An ""IP lawyer"" typically refers to a solicitor who specialises in intellectual property law and may collaborate with a barrister for litigation.

Qualifications:

 All lawyers must hold a law degree, be admitted to legal practice in an Australian jurisdiction, and maintain a practising certificate. Solicitors and barristers are separately regulated and may also pursue specialist accreditation in IP law. 

 

 

What they can do (for example but not limited to):

 

* Advise you on different areas of IP law, often including infringement, licensing, ownership, commercialisation, and enforcement.

* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.

* Draft and negotiate legally binding agreements such as licences, assignments, confidentiality agreements (also referred to as non-disclosure agreements or NDAs), and terms of use.

* Issue or respond to cease and desist letters relating to potential IP infringement

* Represent you in dispute resolution processes such as negotiation, mediation, and appearances in lower courts.

* Manage the legal aspects of an IP dispute and manage complex or higher court proceedings.

* Help identify and mitigate legal risks associated with creating, using, or enforcing IP.

It's a good idea to ask for an indication of how much the entire process may cost during your first meeting. IP lawyers have a professional obligation to provide you with an upfront estimate of their fees and costs.

What they don't do:

 Lawyers generally do not prepare technical IP specifications unless they are also registered as patent attorneys. Generally speaking, if your legal matter goes to court, solicitors will work with a barrister to represent you in court. 

By engaging an IP professional, they will aim to provide their services to achieve your intended outcome - but they are obliged to follow the instructions you provide them. While they can advise you on certain courses of action, you have the ultimate decision and responsibility.

101-9,Infringement 101,Key considerations for overseas infringement?,"If you find that someone is using your intellectual property overseas, consider:
1. Do you have IP rights in that country?
Before taking action, ensure that you have registered your IP rights in the relevant country. Without local protection, your options for enforcement are limited.
When protecting your IP in Australia, it is a good time to consider filing for protection in other countries as well. When deciding where to seek protection, consider filing in countries where you manufacture products, where you sell or intend to sell, where you may encounter copying risks, or where your competitors are based. The cost of obtaining protection in multiple countries can be significant, so most businesses need to prioritise based on commercial importance and risk.
For some IP that requires registration, specifically patents and trade marks, the World Intellectual Property Organisation can facilitate the filing of applications in multiple countries. See 

How to Apply for IP Overseas

 for more information.
2. Different laws and enforcement standards
Every country has its own IP laws, registration requirements, court systems, and enforcement practices. What might be viewed as infringement in Australia could be treated differently elsewhere.
For example,

the protection of trade marks can vary significantly. Some countries, like China, Indonesia, or Thailand, follow a first-to-file system, where rights are generally granted to the first person to register the trade mark, regardless of whether they have used it in the market. In Australia, prior use of a trade mark can provide protection and rights, allowing a party that used a mark first to oppose or seek cancellation of a later registration.
Such differences can create issues for businesses expanding internationally. Consider a business owner, Sean, who sells branded shoes in Australia under the name 'Voice'. Later, he discovers that someone in China is selling shoes under the same name. Upon further investigation, he finds that this person has registered 'Voice' as a trade mark for shoes in China. Because China operates under a first-to-file system, Sean would likely encounter challenges in contesting the Chinese trade mark registration.
3. Costs and practical challenges
Overseas enforcement can involve significant expenses that exceed your expectations. You will likely need to engage local legal representation since foreign lawyers are generally not permitted to appear in the courts of other countries. Translation costs can be substantial, especially in countries where all documents must be officially translated. Foreign legal procedures can be challenging to navigate and may lead to significantly higher legal fees.
4. Online infringement crosses borders
The internet has made the territorial nature of IP rights more complex. A website selling infringing products might be hosted in one country, operated from another, and cater to customers globally. This situation creates practical challenges in determining where to take action. Generally, it's most effective to focus on where the most damage occurs. Consider where your customers or the infringers are located.
Online marketplaces present both challenges and opportunities. While infringers can easily reach customers through platforms like Amazon, many of these platforms have established procedures for addressing IP complaints and assist in removing infringing material or listings.",General
101-9,Infringement 101,Enforcement options?,"When addressing overseas infringement, you have a range of options, each carrying different costs and likelihood of success. Some options include:
Direct negotiation.

Sometimes, a letter of demand from local lawyers can resolve matters without the need for court proceedings. This is often the most cost-effective first step.
Platform takedown notices.

Many e-commerce platforms have IP complaint procedures for online infringement, enabling rights holders to request the removal of infringing listings.
Customs enforcement.

Countries like Australia allow IP rights holders to register with customs authorities, which enables officials to identify and seize infringing goods at the border. This can be particularly effective for physical products being imported.
Legal proceedings.

Court action is appropriate when the infringement is causing significant commercial damage or when other methods have been unsuccessful. Legal proceedings should be a last resort due to their costs, complexity, and uncertainty in foreign legal systems.",General
101-9,Infringement 101,Practical tips?,"Preventing issues is always better when it comes to international IP protection. Consider filing for protection in key markets early, ideally before launching products or services. While this requires an upfront investment, it's generally far less costly than trying to stop infringement once it has already begun.
Addressing overseas IP infringement is a complicated and often costly process. Consider consulting an IP lawyer who specialises in international IP protection and enforcement. They can offer specific advice tailored to your situation and help you craft a cost-effective international IP strategy. While it's frustrating to see your IP copied internationally, weigh the costs against the potential benefits carefully. Focus your resources on protecting key markets where enforcement is practical and commercially justified.",General
B1020,Trade mark non-use action,What are the benefits?,"* A successful application to remove a trade mark from the register removes the other party's rights to the trade mark that is allegedly being infringed.

* It can a simple, fast and low-cost option when a registered trade mark in question. If your application to remove a trade mark on the basis of non-use is unopposed, your request will be actioned following the two-month opposition period.

* In about 60% of cases, removal applications will not lead to an adversarial process, as those who are genuinely not using their trade marks typically do not oppose the application for removal.

* This process is also accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.",Benefits
B1020,Trade mark non-use action,What are the risks?,"* When applying to remove the other party's trade mark from the register on the basis of non-use, the owner of the trade mark will be notified of your application and details within one month of filing. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the other party be aware of your identity and actions.

* Due to the public nature of these procedures there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to submit an application to remove the other party's trade mark should be considered as part of your IP or brand protection strategy.

* Any person can oppose your request for removal within 2 months of the publishing date and tell IP Australia that they disagree that the trade mark has not been used. If you wish to respond to the opposition and establish that there is a case for removal based on non-use, this will lengthen the removal process and take up further cost, time and efforts.

* A party who is dissatisfied with IP Australia's decision can also appeal it to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART), or Federal Courtorthe FederalCircuit and FamilyCourt, which could be highly time-consuming and costly.",Risks
B1020,Trade mark non-use action,What are the possible outcomes?,"If the application for removal is advertised and no one opposes it within the required time:
* The trade mark will be completely removed from the Register, or

* The trade mark will partially be removed from the Register, namely in relation to the goods and services as specified in your application for removal.
If the other party opposes your request to remove their trade mark within the two-month opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition.
The person opposing the removal of the trade mark is required to establish, by filing evidence, that they have used the trade mark for the goods and services which are the subject of the removal application or that there are other circumstances justifying the non-use of the mark.
IP Australia will follow the processes prescribed in the law to decide the outcome, which could be any of the following:
* The trade mark will be completely, or partially, removed from the Register (as above).

* The Registrar decides the trade mark should remain registered.

* In rare cases, the scope of the registered mark is limited in some way (e.g. to a specific territory).",General
B1020,Trade mark non-use action,What might the costs be?,"There is a fee of $350 for filing the removal application. The process can, however, incur further costs when your application is opposed. For instance, IP Australia may decide in favour of the opposition and require you to pay the other party's costs.
If you are engaging a legal professional to act on your behalf, you will likely incur additional legal fees.",Costs
B1020,Trade mark non-use action,How much time might be involved?,"The length of this process largely depends on whether someone opposes your application to remove for non-use.
If nobody opposes the application for removal within two months, the registration will be removed.

* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months

* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months

* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1
The timeframe is typically shorter if the matter is resolved through negotiations or a court-ordered mediation process.
If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.
Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.

* If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.

There are a variety of options available across a spectrum.

Take no immediate action
Sometimes, the infringement might be minor, unintentional, or not worth pursuing. Reflect on whether the infringement has a negative impact on your business and whether taking action could involve reputational risk.
Direct contact
A polite letter or email explaining your intellectual property rights and requesting that the infringement stop can sometimes resolve matters quickly. The infringement may be unintentional, and the other party might be willing to stop once informed.
Sending a formal letter
A lawyer can draft a more formal letter outlining your rights, the nature of the infringement, and demanding that specific actions be taken to stop the infringement.
Alternative dispute resolution
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) enables you to settle disputes with the assistance of skilled facilitators. Mediation or arbitration can resolve disputes more quickly and cheaply than court proceedings. They offer opinions, facilitate agreements between the parties, or provide binding or non-binding decisions.
Legal proceedings

This concept applies across all types of intellectual property (IP) rights protected under Australian law, including patents, trade marks, designs, copyright, and plant breeders' rights.

101-10,Infringement 101,What does infringement mean?,"At its simplest, infringement occurs when someone uses another's protected creative work or invention without that person's permission or consent. Australian law gives creators and inventors legal protection and rights over their work. Australian IP law protects various types of intellectual creations. These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders' rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.
When someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement.
Think of it as using someone else's property without asking. Just as you would not use someone's car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.

For infringement to occur, the creative work or invention must first be protected under the law. This means answering the question, 'What exactly is protected?' Different rules apply to different types of IP and protect only specific aspects of creation or innovation.
Some types of IP, like patents, trade marks, and designs, must be officially registered with IP Australia to be protected. On the other hand, IP rights, such as copyright, are automatically protected when certain conditions are met.
Importantly, IP rights must be in place that have not expired. The various IP rights last for different periods:
* Patents generally last up to 20 years

* Trade marks can last forever if renewed

* Designs last a maximum of 10 years

* Copyright lasts generally 70 years after the creator dies

* Plant breeders' rights last up to 20 or 25 years, depending on the plant variety.
2. Someone used it without permission
The person or business must use the protected IP without proper permission (commonly called the alleged infringer). 

Without some form of ""yes, you can use this,"" using protected IP might be considered infringement.

 Permission might be granted through:
* Written agreement allowing its use (called a licence)

* Written agreement to transfer ownership (called an assignment)

* Informal permission (verbal agreement or consent).
3. What they are using is too similar
When determining infringement, the material created or the activity of the alleged infringer is examined. The alleged infringing material or activity must be sufficiently similar to the protected IP to create a problem. How this is judged under the law depends on the type of IP involved. Different tests are applied to determine what constitutes a problematic level of similarity.
* For patents: Are they using what a granted patent specifically describes and claims?

* For trade marks: Are they using a trade mark that is too similar and likely to confuse customers, and is it being used on similar goods or services?

* For designs: Does the product look too much like the protected design?

* For copyright: Have they copied a substantial part of the original work?

* For plant breeders' rights: Have they propagated or copied the protected plant variety?
4. How it is being used matters
How the IP is used is an important factor in determining infringement though the requirements vary by the IP type:
* Trade marks: To infringe a registered trade mark, someone needs to use something similar to the registered mark to brand or identify their products or services in the marketplace. Mentioning the brand name in conversation or for informational purposes, or in non-commercial contexts, is generally not infringement.

* Designs: Infringement typically involves making, importing, selling, or using products that incorporate the protected design. While often commercial, infringement can occur in non-commercial contexts.

* Patents: Infringement occurs when someone makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports the patented invention without permission.

* Plant breeders' rights: Infringement is primarily in commercial contexts, involving production, reproduction, conditioning for propagation, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, or stocking of the protected plant variety.

* Copyright: Copyright infringement can occur in both commercial and non-commercial situations. Copying, distributing, performing, or displaying copyrighted works without permission can be infringement.
5. When using someone's IP might be allowed
Even if someone is using IP in a way that appears to infringe, there may be legal defences or exceptions that allow their use. Each type of IP right has its own defences. Here are some common defences:
* Trade marks:Using your own name in business is a defence.

* Patents: Using a patented invention for experimental use, like research and testing, is a defence.

* Copyright:Using copyright material for research or study, criticism or review, parody or satire, or news reporting are defences.

* Designs:Making parts needed to repair a complex product is a defence.

* Plant breeders' rights: Using a plant variety for the purpose of experimentation, further breeding, like cross breeding, or using the variety for private and non-commercial use.",General
101-10,Infringement 101,Example scenarios?,"Here are some general examples that illustrate potential IP infringement situations:
* Example 1: A small business develops and uses a logo that closely resembles another cafe's registered trade mark. Even without the intention to copy, this similarity could constitute infringement if it might confuse consumers about the source of the services.

* Example 2: A manufacturer creates a product using a method that incorporates all the essential steps described in someone else's granted patent. This is likely infringement, even if they were unaware of the patent.

* Example 3: A website copies an image from another website without asking for permission. This may constitute copyright infringement, even if the website provides a source for the image.",General
101-10,Infringement 101,Common misconceptionsmyths about ip infringement?,"There are several misunderstandings about IP infringement that many people believe:
* ""If I change it by 10%, it's not infringement"": Each IP right has different tests for when something is too similar. No fixed percentage change automatically avoids infringement.

* ""I didn't know they owned it"": Not knowing about someone else's IP rights usually is not a defence against infringement.

* ""I'm not charging for it, so it's not infringement"": Even if you are not making money from it, using someone's IP without permission can still be infringement.

* ""I'm giving credit to the creator"": Acknowledging the source of material does not necessarily avoid infringement.

* ""It's not registered, so I can use it "": Some IP rights, like copyright, do not require registration to be protected.",General
101-10,Infringement 101,Why it's hard to figure out on your own?,"Determining whether infringement has occurred can be tricky and often needs legal expertise. Courts make the final decisions on infringement cases, and many involve complicated legal arguments. Things that make it hard to assess include:
* The complexity of IP laws

* Understanding precisely what is protected

* Judging whether something is too similar

* Knowing which exceptions or defences might apply

* Keeping up with changes in how courts interpret the laws.",General
D1005,Court - Trade mark,What are the benefits?,"* If you succeed, a court can award damages or compensation for losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made by an infringer through their infringement).

* Court decisions are binding and enforceable.

* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.

* You can often resolve several related matters in one case.

* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.

* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.

* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage the other party to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid the court proceedings continuing.

* For infringement claims, a court can, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent the other party from continuing to infringe your IP rights.",Benefits
D1005,Court - Trade mark,What are the risks?,"* The outcome can be unpredictable.

* While a court can determine matters of law, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.

* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you.

* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties if you are wholly (or partially) unsuccessful.

* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you.

* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful and time-consuming and distract from the operation of your business

* Court proceedings are usually public, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.

* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.

* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.

* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).

* You may not be able to bring a legal claim if you have agreed in a contract that you will use, or that you will first try, an alternative form of dispute resolution.",Risks
D1005,Court - Trade mark,What are the possible outcomes?,"here are a wide range of possible outcomes, and these will also depend on the type of court action you might take. Some possible outcomes are:
* You might reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.

* The other party might not respond or participate in the court proceedings, in which case the court might decide in your favour.

* The other party's trade mark registration might be cancelled, removed or amended.

* The court might decide against you, in which case your trade mark registration could be cancelled, removed or amended and you may need to pay some or all of the other party's legal costs.

* You could be awarded damages or compensation.

* A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your IP rights - including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter (seeSeek an urgent injunction).

* A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.

* Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims forpassing offor under the Australian Consumer Law).
In most cases, the outcome can be appealed to a higher court.",General
D1005,Court - Trade mark,What might the costs be?,"Infringement and other court proceedings are generally very expensive as legal representation is usually involved and they can take a long time to resolve. Companies in particular are generally required by court rules to be represented by legal practitioners.
Legal fees and the cost of expert witnesses usually make up most of the cost.
It is common for the costs of trade mark-related litigation in the Federal Court of Australia to exceed $100,000.",Costs
D1005,Court - Trade mark,How much time might be involved?,"Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, which court hears your claim, and the backlog of matters before that court.
Trade mark claims are typically heard by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed 

intellectual property

 as the cause of action, were as follows:
* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months

* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months

* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1
The timeframe is typically shorter if the matter is resolved through negotiations or a court-ordered mediation process.
If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.
Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.
Limitations on how long you can take to file an action
There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start.
* The limitation period for a trade mark infringement action in most Australian states is six years from the date on which the first act of infringement took place, with the exception of Northern Territory where the limitation period is three years.

* If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.
Due to these complexities, it may be helpful to speak to an IP lawyer about time limits.",Time

Additionally, insurers typicallydo not cover disputes or infringements that are already known, in progress or on the horizon.

* Insurer control over litigation strategy:When a claim arises, the insurance company may want to settle quickly to minimise costs, even if you would prefer to continue to fight the claim. In some cases, this can lead to a conflict between the insurer's cost-control objectives and your business goals.

This concept applies across all types of intellectual property (IP) rights protected under Australian law, including patents, trade marks, designs, copyright, and plant breeders' rights.
Understanding the basics of IP infringement is essential for anyone who creates, innovates, or operates a business in Australia. This article provides a general introduction to the concept of infringement and what it means for both IP owners and those who may use others' IP.",General
101-10,Infringement 101,What does infringement mean?,"At its simplest, infringement occurs when someone uses another's protected creative work or invention without that person's permission or consent. Australian law gives creators and inventors legal protection and rights over their work. Australian IP law protects various types of intellectual creations. These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders' rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.
When someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement.
Think of it as using someone else's property without asking. Just as you would not use someone's car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.

101-6,Infringement 101,What is an unregistered trade mark?,"Not all trade marks used in Australian marketplaces are registered with IP Australia. In certain circumstances, the law protects these ""unregistered"" trade marks. The law will offer protection or remedy when someone wrongfully appropriates a brand name, logo, slogan, or another identifying mark that is too similar to someone else's that has built up a reputation in the Australian marketplace. The use of a similar trade mark must lead to consumers being deceived or confused, and likely cause damage to the owner.",General
101-6,Infringement 101,Legal protection for unregistered trade marks?,"Since unregistered trade marks are not protected under the 

Trade Marks Act

, businesses may rely on two alternative legal frameworks. These prevent someone from gaining a commercial advantage by wrongfully taking the identifying attributes of another's business.

1
1. An action for passing off
The common law action of passing off protects the goodwill or reputation associated with an unregistered trade mark. A successful passing off action must prove:

2
* A business has established goodwill or reputation in a trade mark or another identifying mark in Australia.

* Another business has made a misrepresentation (intentional or not) that is likely to deceive or confuse consumers. For example, consumers are confused thinking that the goods or services come from one business and not the other.

* The business has suffered or is likely to suffer damage as a result.

For example,

a small café called ""Koala Brews"" operates in Brisbane for 15 years, developing strong local recognition in the name. When a new coffee shop opens nearby with a similar name and logo called ""Kola Brews"", causing customer confusion. The original café may have grounds for a passing off action.
2. Australian Consumer Law (ACL)
Competition and Consumer Act 2010

 (Cth) prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct and false representations.

3

 These provisions can protect unregistered trade marks when:
* A competitor's conduct misleads consumers about the origin of goods or services

* A business falsely claims association, sponsorship, or approval

* A business makes false representations about goods or services.

For example

, a clothing manufacturer uses a logo that closely resembles that of a well-known Australian designer, leading consumers to believe they are purchasing the designer's products. Even without a registered trade mark, the designer may have grounds for an action under the ACL.",General
101-6,Infringement 101,Key differences between registered and unregistered trade marks?,"Registered Trade Marks

 

Unregistered Trade Marks

 

Protected under the 

Trade Marks Act 1995

(Cth).

 

Protected through an action for passing off and the Australian Consumer Law.

 

Protection across Australia when registered.

 

Protection where reputation has been established in Australia.

 

Exclusive rights to use the trade mark for the registered goods/services.

 

Passing off protects a right of property in business or goodwill, whereas the Australian Consumer Law protects consumers against misleading and deceptive conduct.

4

 

Infringement does not require proof of reputation, misrepresentation or damage. See [trade mark infringement card]

 

The owner must prove reputation, misrepresentation and damage in court. 

 

Longer-term protection (renewable every 10 years).

 

Protection exists as long as the trade mark is used, and the reputation continues.

Navigating the protection of unregistered marks can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Given that unregistered trade marks are not filed with IP Australia, experts can help work out what is protected and how it might be misused. Court actions for passing off and ACL violations can be more complex, time-consuming, and costly. Additionally, these actions may also be pursued in conjunction with trade mark infringement cases. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

D1087,Court - Designs,What are the benefits?,"* If you succeed, a court can award damages or compensation for losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made in relation to the infringement).

* Court decisions are binding and enforceable between the parties to the proceedings.

* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.

* You can often resolve several related matters in one case.

* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.

* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.

* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage the other party to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid the court proceedings continuing.

* For suspected infringement claims, a court can, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent the other party from continuing to infringe your registered design.",Benefits
D1087,Court - Designs,What are the risks?,"* The outcome can be unpredictable.

* While a court can determine the dispute between the parties, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.

* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you, including challenges to the validity of your design.

* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties.

* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you. This can have implications for any costs you may incur.

* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful, time-consuming, and distract from the operation of your business.

* Court proceedings are usually public unless they are covered by a confidentiality order, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.

* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.

* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.

* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).

* If you intend to commence proceedings against a party that you have a pre-existing contractual agreement with, it may be important to consider whether the agreement covers ways to deal with IP disputes.

* The other party's registered design might be cancelled or amended.

* The court might decide against you, in which case your registered design could be cancelled and you may need to pay some or all of the other party's legal costs.

* You could be awarded damages.

* A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your design rights - including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter.

* A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.

* Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims under the Australian Consumer Law).

For comparison, simple patent-related litigation may cost 

between $100-500k

Because of the lack of legal precedent for designs. It is likely that any designs dispute in court will be very expensive.",Costs
D1087,Court - Designs,How much time might be involved?,"Court cases can take months or years to conclude, depending on complexity, the evidence required, and whether there are appeals. Interim injunctions (temporary orders to stop suspected infringement) may be available more quickly, but full proceedings generally take much longer.

The timeframe is typically shorter if the matter is resolved through negotiations or a court-ordered mediation process.

 

If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.

 

Limitations on how long you can take to file an action

There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start.
* The limitation period for a designs infringement action is six years from the date on which the act of infringement took place. The infringement act must also have taken place in the period of registration.

* If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.

101-8,Infringement 101,What is trade markinfringement?,"Trade mark infringement can occur when someone uses a brand name, logo, slogan, or another identifying mark that is too similar to someone else's registered trade mark,

1 

particularly if it is for the same or similar goods or services.

2

 

This can lead to confusion among consumers about the source of the goods or services being offered.
In Australia, there are laws protecting registered trade marks (specifically the 

Trade Marks Act 1995

 (Cth)). A registered trade mark gives its owners the exclusive right to use the trade mark in Australia and the ability to stop others from using the trade marks without permission.

3",General
101-8,Infringement 101,What is protected under a registered trade mark?,"Understanding what a registered trade mark protects is essential to identifying infringement.

4

 A trade mark registered with IP Australia gives its owner exclusive rights based on two key components:

5
* The sign itself- the word, logo, phrase, or other trade mark registered (seeKinds of Trade Marksfor more information).6

* The goods and services- those listed in the registration (seeClasses of Goods and Servicesfor more information).7
Protection is generally limited to these combined elements.

8

 For example, a person will infringe a registered trade mark if they use a similar trade mark with the same or similar goods or services listed in the registration. In contrast, there may be no infringement if a similar sign is used for completely different goods or services.

9
However, the law does protect well-known trade marks in some cases.

10

 Infringement 

can

 occur when a well-known trade mark is used in relation to goods or services unrelated to the registered trade mark.

11",General
101-8,Infringement 101,How does trade mark infringement happen?,"Where a trade mark is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:
1. Someone

uses

a sign ""as a trade mark""
This is a crucial requirement. The infringer must use the sign as a 'badge of origin,'

12

 or in other words, to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services.

13

 This involves using the trade mark to identify or differentiate their products or services in the marketplace.

14

 This requirement limits infringement and allows for legitimate references to trade marks in contexts that do not suggest commercial origin.
Examples of use as a trade

mark

:
* Applying the sign to product packaging or labels15

* Using the sign in advertising to promote goods or services16

* Displaying the sign on business signage or storefronts17

* Using the sign on websites to market products18
Examples that are not use as a

trade

mark:
* Using a word in its ordinary descriptive sense (e.g., using ""apple"" to refer to the fruit)19

* Referring to a trade mark for informational purposes20

* Using a sign purely for functional or decorative purposes21
2. Someone uses an almost 

identical 

trade mark or one that is similar enough to confuse people
This is when someone uses a trade mark that resembles or sounds almost exactly like a registered trade mark,

22

 with only tiny differences that would go unnoticed by most consumers.
For example,

 suppose the word ""KOALA COMFORTS"" is a registered trade mark for bedding products. In that case, using ""KOALA KOMFORTS"" (just changing the spelling) for similar products would likely be considered too similar. Alternatively, someone uses a trade mark that, despite having some differences, is too similar to the registered trade mark. This similarity is likely to confuse consumers about who produces the product or provides the services.

23

 For instance, it may look or sound similar enough to a registered trade mark.
For example,

 if ""BLUE WAVE"" with a wave picture is a registered trade mark for surfboards (see below), using ""BLU WAIVES"" with a similar wave design for surf gear could confuse customers into thinking they are from the same company.

When looking at possible trade mark infringement, courts compare the registered trade mark with the alleged infringing trade mark and consider:
* How similar the trade marks look and sound24

* The impression left by the trade marks25

* Whether the trade marks convey the same idea26

* Where and how the products are sold27

* Whether the typical customer would take the time to notice differences28

* Whether anyone has actually been confused.29
3. Using the mark on the same or similar goods

or

services
Lastly, the trade mark is used to sell goods or services that are the same or similar to those listed in the registered trade mark. Therefore, infringement can still occur even when the trade mark is used for goods or services that are not identical to those covered by a registered trade mark but are similar or closely related.

30
For example,

 if ""SUNNY DAYS"" is registered for coffee, using ""SUNNY DAYS"" for soft drinks might infringe because both products are related to non-alcoholic beverages.

31

 Customers might think the same company makes them.
Again, courts consider several factors when determining whether goods or services are similar or closely related.

32
Alternatively, infringement can occur when someone uses a 'well known' trade mark in relation to goods or services unrelated to those listed in the registration.

33

 However, this kind of infringement has not been heard much in court, and its scope is not currently clear.",General
101-8,Infringement 101,What is not trade markinfringement?,"It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The 

Trade Marks Act 1995

 provides several situations where a trade mark is not infringed, including a person who is:
* using their own name in good faith as a trade mark.34

* just describing the goods or services, or stating where your business is located.35

* indicating the intended purpose of the goods or services (like ""fits iPhone models"").36

* comparing the goods or services to others.37

* using an already registered trade mark.38

* using a trade mark that they could obtain registration for.39

* using a mark that they had before the other mark was registered.40

* re-selling or re-distributing goods that initially used the mark with the owner's permission (including parallel imports41",General
101-8,Infringement 101,Understanding theboundariesof protection?,"It is essential to recognise that trade mark protection has limitations. Let's say, for example, you register ""SMARTBREW"" for coffee machines

 

(listed under class 11) and coffee beans (listed under class 30). Potential infringement situations include:
* Clear infringement:Another business begins selling coffee machines using the name ""SMARTBREW""The alleged infringing mark is being used as a trade mark (it is on the machine and advertising). The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" are identical. The alleged infringing mark is being used for identical products (coffee machines).

* Possible infringement:Another business starts selling coffee filters using ""STARTBREW"". The business is using ""STARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging). The registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" and the alleged infringing mark ""STARTBREW"" look similar and sound similar. Consumers might be confused about where they came from. The mark is being used on related but not identical goods. Courts would consider how similar these goods are.

* Unlikely to be infringement:A company uses ""SMARTBREW"" for completely unrelated goods like gardening tools. The business is using ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark (it is on the product packaging). The marks are identical, but the company uses the trade mark on goods that differ from the registered trade mark.

* Not infringement:A coffee critique writes a review of the product entitled ""Is SmartBrew worth the money?""The article's author is not using the word ""SMARTBREW"" as a trade mark.

* Not infringement:Another company uses a different coffee-related name, like ""CLEVER COFFEE"", for coffee machines. The business is using ""CLEVER COFFEE"" as a trade mark. However, ""CLEVER COFFEE"" and the registered trade mark ""SMARTBREW"" are too dissimilar.
Navigating trade mark infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Additionally, the registered trade mark must be legally valid. A registered trade mark may be challenged in court and sought to be cancelled during a claim of infringement. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

D1028,Negotiation,What are the possible outcomes?,"Commercial negotiations can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the parties' desires and specific circumstances. Some popular forms of commercial arrangements involving IP include:
Licensing
You can agree to a licensing agreement. Licensing involves the owner of the IP or someone else with a right to licence the IP (the licensor) giving someone else (the licensee) permission to use - but not own - their IP usually in exchange for payment. For detailed information on types of licences and licence conditions, see 

How To Licence My IP | IP Australia

.
Assignment (selling or transferring your IP)
You may decide to sell your IP as part of your negotiation with the other party. This involves transferring the ownership of the IP to another entity (the assignee) through a process called 'assignment' so that you no longer have the rights to use the IP.
Once assignment is completed, you won't have any control over the IP asset you have sold unless you have agreed that the assignee licence some rights back to you. The assignee will bear the risk of commercial development of the IP and be responsible for all costs, including renewal fees paid to IP Australia.
Once the title of a registered IP right has been assigned through a contractual agreement, the transfer of the ownership can be recorded on the IP Australia register through IP Australia's

Online Services portal

.
Franchising (trade marks)
In a franchise agreement, you can give one or more parties (the franchisees) the right to use your trade mark or trade name, your business systems and processes, and so on.
The licensed rights are typically used by the franchisees to provide goods or services to agreed specifications. In return, they pay royalties and fees. Franchisees often contribute to marketing costs for the brand as well. Franchising is a highly regulated area of law and you should consult with a franchising expert such as a franchising lawyer before agreeing to a franchising agreement

.
Letter of consent or co-existence agreement (trade marks)
Trade mark owners can negotiate to have their trade marks co-exist in the market. This can allow both parties to use potentially conflicting rights in ways that both agree to (such as in certain geographical areas).

101-5,Infringement 101,What is protected by copyright?,"Copyright protects original creative works without requiring registration.

1

 

In Australia, copyright protection generally lasts for 70 years after the author's death. 

Protection is automatic once the work is created and documented.

2

 Additionally, 

there is no need to use the © symbol next to the protected work.

Copyright provides legal protection for people who express their ideas in an original way.

3

 Ideas alone cannot be protected under copyright law.

4

Copyright protects several types of creative works, including:
* Literary works (like books, articles, computer programs, software code, song lyrics and poems).5

* Artistic works (like paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, maps, diagrams and works of artistic craftsmanship).6

* Musical works(musical compositions or the notes and arrangement).7

* Dramatic works (like plays, scripts, dance choreography, mime performances).8
Copyright also protects creations of other technologies, including:
* Sound recordings.9

* Films.10

* Television and radio broadcasts.11

* Published editions (that is, the typographical arrangement in a book).12

The duration of copyright protection can vary depending on the type of copyrighted material.

Importantly, copyright material created overseas can be protected in Australia. Suppose the material is made by someone in a country that is a party to a relevant international copyright convention to which Australia is also a party. In that case, it will also be protected in Australia.

13",General
101-5,Infringement 101,What rights do copyright owners have?,"Copyright law grants the owner the right to control how their work is used. 

These rights vary depending on the type of work, but generally include:
* Reproduction:Making copies of the work.14

* Publication:Making the work publicly available for the first time.15

* Public performance:Performing the work in public.16

* Communication to the public:Transmitting the work electronically (e.g., online).17

* Adaptation:Creating adaptations, such as translations or screen adaptations.18

For sound recordings, films, and broadcasts, the rights include making copies, playing them in public, and communicating them to the public.

19",General
101-5,Infringement 101,When does copyright infringement occur?,"Australian copyright law grants authors and creators exclusive control over their material.

20

 Generally, copyright is infringed if a person performs one of the exclusive acts reserved to the copyright owner 

without the copyright owner's permission, and an exception or limitation does not apply

. 

21

Depending on how the copyright material was used, the following requirements need to be proven to establish infringement.
1. Someone reproduces the copyright work
Reproduction involves some form of copying. To establish infringement, three key elements must be shown:
* The whole or a ""substantial"" part of the copyright-protected work has been used. Infringement can occur even if a part of it was copied. ""Substantial"" refers to quality rather than quantity. Even a small but important or distinctive part may be substantial. Courts will look at the entirety of the original copyright work and consider whether the quality or essential part of the work was copied.22

* There is a connection between the copyright-protected work and the copied work. Infringement will generally be found if there was access to the copyright work.23Independent creation is unlikely to be an infringement.24

* There is an objective similarity between the original copyright-protected work and the copied work. Courts compare the works to determine if there is an objective similarity. Literal copying is straightforward, but courts may struggle if the similarities are not apparent.25
Copyright law will automatically consider copying to occur when a

 literary, dramatic or musical work has been made into a sound recording or film

26

 or converted into digital form.

27

 Additionally, an artistic work in two-dimensional form will be infringed if it has been made into three dimensions and vice versa.

28
2. Someone publishes the work
Infringement will occur when someone makes something available to the public in Australia that was not previously available.

29
3. Someone performs the work in public
Infringement will happen when someone performs the work for members of the public.
4. Someone communicates the work to the public
Infringement will occur if someone makes the work available to the public by uploading it to the Internet, for example.

30
5. Someone copies a sound recording, film or broadcast
Infringement occurs when someone makes a copy of a sound recording or film and plays or shows it in public.

31",General
101-5,Infringement 101,Common misconceptions about copyright infringement?,"""I changed it by 10%, so it's not infringement.""

There is no percentage rule. Even small portions can infringe if they are an important or distinctive part of the original work.

""I gave credit to the creator.""

Attribution does not prevent infringement.

""It was only for personal use.""

Personal use is not a general exception to copyright infringement in Australia, though specific exceptions may apply.

""I found it online, so it's free to use.""

Works found online are still protected by copyright law unless it is in the public domain or under an open licence.",General
101-5,Infringement 101,When is using copyright material allowed?,"It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. Notably, w

hen copyright protection expires, the material enters what is known as the ""public domain."" These works can be freely used.

The Copyright Act also provides numerous defences and exceptions that enable some use of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner in certain circumstances. These exceptions permit ""fair dealings"" with copyright material for particular purposes, including:
* research or study32

* criticism or review33

* reporting of news34

* giving of professional legal advice35

* parody and satire36

* making accessible format copies by, or on behalf of, a person with a disability.37
Determining copyright infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Experts can help work out exactly what is protected by copyright and how it has been copied. Additionally, they can assess the available defences and exceptions under the Copyright Act that can affect the outcome. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.

D1021,Trade mark registration revocation,What are the benefits?,"* There is no cost involved in giving this information to IP Australia.

D1021,Trade mark registration revocation,What are the risks?,"* IP Australia does not have an obligation to consider a request to revoke a trade mark registration. As such, it might be risky to base your entire enforcement strategy on this procedure expecting IP Australia to make a revocation decision, instead of using other enforcement mechanisms such as challenging the trade mark registration through the court system.

* While IP Australia does not publish the details of the party who requested revocation, it is possible for documents to be obtained under Freedom of Information Act 1982 so the owner of the trade mark can ascertain the identity of the party who requested revocation.

* This procedure provides a much more limited opportunity to participate in the decision-making process, when compared to challenging a trade mark registration through the opposition and hearing procedures or courts.

* Even if revocation of acceptance follows revocation of registration, the application will be returned to examination and the owner of the application will be given 15 months to overcome the grounds for rejection preventing their application from achieving acceptance.

* In some rare cases, the application may only be reverted to acceptance stage even though the registration has been revoked, meaning that opposition process would need to be initiated to block the application proceeding to registration once more.

* Once the revocation procedure is initiated, IP Australia must give the owner of the registered trade mark the opportunity to be heard on the revocation (to put their case forward why it shouldn't be revoked). If they are successful, the registration will be maintained. If they are unsuccessful, the registration can be revoked.

* Hearing officers in IP Australia have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.

* The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.

* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.",Benefits
B1019,Opposition process,What are the risks?,"* If your opposition is unsuccessful and the trade mark proceeds to registration, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.

* When opposing the registration of a trade mark, the applicant will be notified of your opposition. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the other party be aware of your actions.

* Due to the public nature of these procedures there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to take an enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy.

* There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.

* Using these procedures improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.

* If you are successful in opposing registration of a trade mark, the denied applicant may appeal the decision to court.

101-4,Infringement 101,What is pbr infringement?,"Infringement of Plant Breeders' Rights (PBRs) can occur when someone 

uses a protected variety 

without the owner's permission. In Australia, PBRs last for 

up to 20 years or 25 years, depending on the plant type.

1",General
101-4,Infringement 101,What are plant breeder's rights?,"PBRs protect new plant varieties.

2

 In Australia, when someone registers a plant variety, they obtain exclusive rights to control how that plant's reproductive materials (such as seeds, cuttings, or bulbs) are used and sold. If another person uses the plant variety without proper permission, 

they may be infringing the owner's rights.

For example,

 the barley variety Spartacus CL or the flowering plant variety called 

LegacyFlame.
While a PBR is granted for a particular new variety of plants and their propagating material (such as seeds or stems), in some cases, breeders can claim further protection. Protection can extend to:
* Harvested material.3

* Products of harvested material.4

* Plant varieties that could only be developed from a PBR-protected variety (known as dependent varieties and essentially derived varieties).5

* Propagating material of dependent varieties and essentially derived varieties.6",General
101-4,Infringement 101,How does pbr infringement happen?,"Where a PBR is registered with IP Australia, the following activities may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without permission of the owner:
1. Someone uses the plant variety
Australian plant variety law gives plant breeders exclusive control over their varieties.

7

 Infringement occurs when a person uses a protected plant variety in ways that only the owner is allowed to do so and without permission.

8

 They could be using the plant variety in different ways, including:

* Producing or reproducing the plant material. This happens when someone creates more plants of the protected variety. Reproduction here is the act of making more plants by growing seeds or using cuttings.9

* Conditioning the plant material for propagation. This happens when someone prepares the plant materials for growing more plants.10For example, cleaning, coating, sorting, packaging, or grading materials such as seeds, stems, and branches.

* Commercialising of propagating material. Including selling (or offering to sell) plants or their reproductive materials, bringing protected plant materials into Australia or sending them overseas or keeping plant materials for any of these commercial purposes.11
2. Someone uses the plant variety name
Infringement can also occur where the protected plant variety name is used on 

other plants or varieties

.

12

 Protection can extend to include a synonym of the plant variety name registered with IP Australia.

13

For example,

 if a plant breeder registers a new rose variety with the name 'SUNSPARK' with the synonym 'SPARK', another grower developing and selling a rose called 'SPARK' would be an infringement.

3. Someone uses an

essentially derived variety
PBR protection also covers plant varieties that are very similar to the protected ones.

14

 Therefore, infringement can occur when someone uses another variety that is considered too similar. Owners of PBRs

 can also seek to have varieties called an essentially derived variety (EDV).

15

 These varieties share all the essential characteristics of a registered plant variety but are distinguishable from one another. See information on PBR 

'Additional rights available'

.

4. Someone uses harvested material
Infringement can also occur 

if someone grows a protected plant variety without permission and harvests material from those plants 

(such as fruit or flowers).

16

 This can also include products 

made from material harvested from the protected variety (such as fruit juice).

17",General
101-4,Infringement 101,What is not pbrinfringement?,"It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. The 

Plant Breeders' Act 1994

 provides several situations where a PBR is not infringed, including:

* Privately using the plant variety for non-commercial purposes.18

* Using the plant variety for experimental purposes.19

* Using the plant variety for breeding other plant varieties.20

* A farmer saves harvested propagating material (such as seeds) and uses that material for the production of further propagating material.21",General
101-4,Infringement 101,Importance of labelling?,"The 

Plant Breeders' Act 1994

recognises that someone might unknowingly infringe a PBR. For instance, using a protected plant material without realising it was protected. Where a court finds infringement has occurred, it may refuse to award damages or to make an order for account of profits against an ""innocent"" infringer.

22

 For a person to be ""innocent"", they must satisfy the court that at the time of infringement, they were not aware that the plant material was protected.

23

However, if the plant variety has been appropriately labelled to indicate its protection, the law assumes that the person should have been aware of its protection under a PBR.

24
This makes proper labelling crucial for owners. It not only informs people about existing rights but also prevents infringers from later claiming they were unaware of the protection. See more information about labelling here: '

How to label my protected plant variety

'.",General
101-4,Infringement 101,Example?,"Imagine Crisp Orchards has developed and registered a new apple variety with the name 'SweetCrunch'. The variety has a distinctive flavour, appearance, and storage qualities. They have obtained PBR protection in Australia.
What would likely be an infringement
* A competing orchard purchases a few 'SweetCrunch' trees and uses cuttings to propagate hundreds more trees without permission

* A nursery imports 'SweetCrunch' from overseas and grafts it onto rootstock to sell to local growers

* A grower obtains 'SweetCrunch' trees legitimately but then sells cuttings to other growers without permission.25
What would unlikely be an infringement
* A consumer purchasing and eating 'SweetCrunch' apples

* A farmer growing 'SweetCrunch' trees with permission from Crisp Orchards

* Using 'SweetCrunch' in a breeding program to develop a new and distinct variety
Determining patent infringement can be complex and often requires expertise in both legal and plant variety matters. For infringement to happen, the PBR must be legally valid. PBRs can be challenged if, for example, the variety is not new, distinct, uniform and stable (for more information, see 

What are plant breeder's rights

).

D1015,Trade mark non-use action,What are the benefits?,"Simple, fast and low-cost (when unopposed)
Removal application can be a simple, fast and low-cost option when a registered trade mark in question has not been used in the marketplace for a considerable period of time, or when the owner of a trade mark does not use or intend to use the trade mark in good faith.
If your application to remove a trade mark on the basis of non-use is unopposed, your request will be actioned following the two-month opposition period.
* In about 60% of cases, removal applications will not lead to an adversarial process, as those who are genuinely not using their trade marks typically do not oppose the application for removal.",Benefits
D1015,Trade mark non-use action,What are the risks?,"Escalation into further opposition process or court proceedings
After an application for removal has been filed and published, any person can oppose it within 2 months of the publishing date and tell IP Australia that they disagree that the trade mark has not been used. If you wish to respond to the opposition and establish that there is a case for removal based on non-use, this will lengthen the removal process and take up further cost, time and efforts.
A party who is dissatisfied with IP Australia's decision can also appeal it to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court of Australia, which could be highly time-consuming and costly.
Exposure resulting from notification and publication
The owner and their representative of the trade mark which is subject to a removal procedure will be notified of your application to remove the trade mark. This notification happens within one month of filing the application. A copy of the application will be forwarded with the notification, which will include your details and the details of your filing.
IP Australia also must give notice of the application for removal by publishing it on the Australian Trade Marks Search ('the Register'). This means that other parties would be aware of your identity and also your attempt to remove the trade mark from the Register. This may trigger the other party to oppose your application or initiate other forms of action (i.e. administrative hearings, court proceedings, etc.) against you and/or your business.",Risks
D1015,Trade mark non-use action,What are the possible outcomes?,"If the application for removal is advertised and no one opposes it within the required time:
* The trade mark will be completely removed from the Register, or

* The trade mark will partially be removed from the Register, namely in relation to the goods and services as specified in your application for removal.
If the other party opposes your request to remove their trade mark within the two-month opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition.
The person opposing the removal of the trade mark is required to establish, by filing evidence, that they have used the trade mark for the goods and services which are the subject of the removal application or that there are other circumstances justifying the non-use of the mark.
IP Australia will follow the processes prescribed in the law to decide the outcome, which could be any of the following:
* The trade mark will be completely, or partially, removed from the Register (as above).

* The Registrar decides the trade mark should remain registered.

* In rare cases, the scope of the registered mark is limited in some way (e.g. to a specific territory).",General
