C1019,IP STRATEGY ,"* Help streamline decision-making if suspected infringement occurs.

* May help you build clear evidence of ownership that deters copycats.

* May help secure investment by demonstrating due diligence on IP.

* May support expansion into new markets or product lines.

* Assist your employees and partners in developing team awareness on how to handle ideas and branding.","* Plans can become outdated if not reviewed regularly, leaving blind spots.

* Over-protection (for example, filing unnecessary patents) may waste resources.

* Relying on internal resources rather than expert input may create false confidence.",,,"* IP rights holders or authorised users managing IP assets.

* Anyone or businesses planning to use, develop or acquire IP assets.",,Developing and implementing a comprehensive IP strategy a common practice used by businesses that own or use multiple IP assets.,Developing a comprehensive IP strategy may not immediately yield a tangible outcome. This option involves preparation and implementation of preventative measures.
101-2,Infringement 101,,,,,,,,
D1039,Apply for a trade mark,"Registering a trade mark offers a range of benefits which can simplify the enforcement process. It provides:
* Exclusive legal rights to use the trade mark commercially (on the goods and services claimed).

* Robust and universally recognised registration (within Australia).

* Clear evidence of ownership date to support your claims.

* Strong negotiating position for settlement discussions.
Some enforcement options are only available if your trade mark is registered. These include the ability to take action against infringement under the 

Trade Marks 1995

, and the ability to lodge an objection to imports of trade mark-infringing goods at the border under the Australian Border Force (ABF) Notice of Objection scheme.
Registration can also make it easier to commercialise and licence your trade mark, and for others to be aware that you claim the rights. Your trade mark will appear on a public, searchable database showing your claim and its scope.","* Registering your trade mark requires an upfront fee that must be paidbeforethe trade mark is examined. This fee is for theexaminationof the trade mark and is thereforenon-refundableif the trade mark is not registrable.

* Applications to register a trade mark are generally public (an exception is TM Headstart). Your competitors might become aware you are trying to register your trade mark. They may take actions like trying to register their own similar trade mark, or oppose your application.

* You might discover that there is a problem with your trade mark, or that someone else has already registered a similar trade mark. This could mean you need to reconsider whether your trade mark is right for you.

* An Australian trade mark registration does not cover you in overseas markets.",,,,,,
E1009,Selling or licensing,,,,,,,,
D1030,Interim court injuction order,"* Rapid cessation of infringement. By halting any infringement immediately, you prevent further damage to your IP, such as erosion of market share or brand reputation.

* Increased leverage in negotiations. The court's willingness to grant an urgent injunction sends a powerful signal to the defendant, which may affect future negotiations.

* Preservation of evidence. An urgent injunction often comes with additional orders that can include the preservation of documents, files or infringing stock.

* Enforceability. There are existing mechanisms in place to ensure people comply with court orders.","* Potential to pay damages. If it later turns out the injunction was unjustified, the applicant may need to compensate the defendant.

* Evidence threshold. While the threshold for an urgent injunction is lower than for a final decision, you still need strong evidence outlining both the infringement and the urgency of the matter.

* Escalation. Seeking an injunction is a serious escalation of a conflict and may make it difficult or use other enforcement actions in future. Additionally, filing an interim injunction requires you to take further actions in court.",,,"Interim injunctions are available for many matters. For IP infringement actions, you'll usually need to clearly own an IP right.",,"In 2024 the Federal Court heard 5 applications for interlocutory injunctions in IP matters, only 2 were granted.","* If the interim injunction is granted, the defending party must cease all activity suspected of infringing.

* This can be extended throughout the trial as an 'interlocutory injunction'. If the subsequent lawsuit is ruled in your favour, the defendant might then face a final, permanent injunction.

* If the subsequent lawsuit is ruled in favour of the defendant, you may be required to compensate the defendant for lost revenue due to the interim injunction. Additionally, you may be liable for subsequent legal costs, and the defendant is free to continue their previous activities.

* If the interim injunction is not granted, the defendant can continue their activities.

* If you continue taking court action for infringement/with the subsequent lawsuit, an injunction or damages may be granted at a later stage."
E1016,IP Disputes ,,,,,,,,
B1013,Court,"* Can help stop unjustified threats which may be negatively impacting your business.

* A court may award compensation if the threat caused damages (for example, loss of sales or customers for your business).","* Escalating the issue to court may prompt the other party to take further enforcement actions such as infringement proceedings or to make other counterclaims against you.

* If the court finds the threat was justified, you may need to pay the other party's costs.

* Court proceedings are generally public so you should consider any reputational impacts.",,,Anyone aggrieved by an unjustified threat.,,"It is common for parties to respond to letters of demand (or cease and desist letters) to dispute threats and, where appropriate, allege that they were unjustified. However, it is not very common for parties to start legal action based solely on the unjustified threats. This is because of the risk that the other party is likely to respond by making a claim of infringement. More commonly, a person might decide to make an unjustified threat counterclaim where the other party starts legal action against them.","The possible outcomes will depend on how you respond to the unjustified threat. For example, whether you try to resolve the matter by writing back to the party or decide to start legal action.
If you decide to start legal action, possible outcomes include:
* The parties resolve their dispute outside of court through mediation, negotiation or another alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process and stop the legal action.

* A court declares the threat unjustified and might also order the other party to stop making threats and/or pay you damages if you have suffered loss as a result of the threat.

* A court finds the threat is justified. You may be required to pay the other party's costs and could face other liabilities if it is found that you were infringing their IP rights."
C1010,e-commerce registeries ,"* May gain access to tools such as bulk takedown forms, automated alerts, image search, and automated scanning tools to flag look-alike listings for review.

* May allow faster removal of suspected infringing listings once you notify the platform.

* There are no or very low enrolment fees, limiting upfront costs low.

* Allows streamlined takedown requests across multiple markets.

* Some IP platforms also offer powerful brand-building and selling tools.","* False positives may require your time to review legitimate sellers.

* Program rules may change, resulting in extra steps or temporary loss of access.",,,"The IP right holder or an authorised user, or their representative.",,Signing up to registries or IP protection program provided by online platforms is a practice commonly used by small to medium businesses that own IP rights.,"* Your enrolment may be accepted and your brand added to the program.

* Your application may be rejected if your IP right details do not match or the status is ineligible. You may be able to appeal this.

* You may need to re-apply or update registration if you add new IP rights (e.g. a new trade mark or a certified design) or change ownership.

* While enrolment on a platform may deter infringement on that particular platform, it may result in simply shifting infringement to other platforms."
C1003,Monitor competitors' IP,"This process helps you make informed decisions about your products and branding:
* Avoid costly infringement by identifying conflicting rights early

* Spot competitor activity and emerging risks in your industry

* Plan around potential legal or commercial barriers

* Identify gaps in the market or opportunities for your own IP

* Build confidence for launching or expanding a product.","* Incomplete information:There is a risk that not all relevant IP is detected, which could result in missed threats and exposure to future claims.

* Incorrect interpretation:There is a risk that search results are misunderstood, which could result in false assumptions about your rights or risks.

* Outdated monitoring:There is a risk your monitoring is not frequent or detailed enough, which could result in late responses to new filings or changes in competitor IP.

* Cost and time burdens:There is a risk that complex or wide-ranging searches become expensive or require specialist support, particularly in international markets.",,,"This option is available to:
* Anyone planning to launch a new product or brand

* Businesses entering new markets or industries

* Existing IP owners checking for similar or competing filings

* Investors or partners conducting due diligence before commercialisation.",,"Monitoring of competitors IP is fairly common in the patent space, particularly in new or rapidly iterating areas. In smaller enterprises, this is more likely to be handled in house, although professional IP monitoring services are also widely used.","* You identify no major risks and proceed with confidence.

* You find IP that blocks your current plans and decide to redesign or rebrand.

* You spot competitor activity early and take action to oppose or challenge it.

* You choose to license existing rights rather than risk infringement.

* You build your own IP strategy around gaps in the competitive landscape."
D1010,Letter of demand,"* Often cost-effective.

* Can be quick to action but needs to be drafted very carefully.

* Reasonable likelihood of stopping infringing behaviour without the need for additional steps - 43.7% of respondents, who are patent holders, found it effective at stopping copying behaviour (Weatherall K and Webster E (2010) 'Patent infringement in Australia: Results from a survey', Federal Law Review, 38, 21-70, 40).

* Allows you to consider many options to escalate, if suspected infringement continues.","* Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation, damages or costs and in you being ordered to stop making the threat.

* Including unreasonably onerous and aggressive terms in your letter (for example, short time frames, demands that do not relate to the IP in question) may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply.

* Exposing yourself to the other party by contacting them might prompt the other party to take actions against you, escalating the conflict in an unwanted way. This could potentially jeopardise your own IP rights.

* For trade marks, it might also prompt the other party to apply for their own trade mark, which may then need to be opposed.

* Sending a letter of demand might give the suspected infringer time to hide or destroy evidence. This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, speak to an IP lawyer before you take any further action.",,,"Someone who owns IP or is an authorised user, and can provide evidence of their rights.",,,"Sending a letter of demand can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the specific circumstances.
Some possible outcomes are:
* The alleged infringing behaviour stops upon receipt of the letter, especially if the recipient was simply unaware of existing IP rights.

* The alleged infringer does not change their behaviour, in which case you may have to consider other enforcement options.

* Parties can engage in further correspondence disputing part or all of your claims.

* The conflict can further escalate into more serious, formal dispute settlement procedures (that is, litigation, arbitration, administrative hearings).

* The other party may not fulfil all the requirements but may be willing to participate in some form of negotiation.

* The other party may commence proceedings challenging the validity of the IP right, or be prompted to take legal action against you (for instance if they are of the opinion that you are infringing on their rights). This could include seeking damages or compensation for unjustified threatsor an order that you stop making the threat."
E1024,Protecting your business,,,,,,,,
B1012,Informal contact,"* Early dialogue can limit legal costs and reduce the risk of expensive and lengthy litigation.

* Settlement terms such as licences or co-existence agreements may lead to practical benefits like agreed market access or ongoing use.

* Confidential negotiations may preserve commercial relationships and business reputation.

* You and the other party keep control of the timeline and proposed solutions.

* When there is an existing relationship to build on (even simply both parties being in the same industry), it can be easier to find productive, business-specific solutions.","* Relies on the other party's willingness to engage or negotiate with you.

* Either party can withdraw from the conversation at any point in time, resulting in wasted time, money and effort.

* If you share sensitive business information without a confidentiality agreement, it may be used against you later.

* A mere verbal agreement, without a signed or executed deed of settlement, may not be easily enforceable.",,,Anyone that has been contacted about allegedly infringing on someone else's IP and wishes to explore co-operative solutions rather than escalating the dispute.,,"Many businesses choose to engage in a dialogue with the other party, with or without obtaining legal advice.","* You both agree that no infringement has occurred, and no further action is taken.

* You and the other party 'agree to disagree', but no further action is taken.

* You reach a financial settlement or pay a one-off fee for past use.

* You enter a licence or co-existence agreement that allows continued use under agreed conditions and undertake not to infringe in the future.

* You can also agree to purchase the IP.

* You agree to alter or withdraw the product, branding or content within a set timeframe.

* You agree to resolve the matter through alternative dispute settlement procedures such as mediation or arbitration.

* One of the parties may choose to take the matter to the court."
D1006,Mediation ,"* Costs and duration of the process is generally quite low.

* Mediation can be conducted across different jurisdictions.

* Less adversarial than other procedures such as arbitration and court proceedings, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party by reducing emotional strain and preventing the discussions from being too heated.

* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.

* Parties can narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides.

* Offers broad, productive or creative solutions to issues.

* Confidentiality, as the details of mediation and the resulting agreements reached are not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.

* Following a mediation outcome, it is open to the parties to the mediation to take further steps between them. This can include entering into a legally binding agreement that incorporates some or all of the outcomes from the mediation, provided the parties clearly intend and agree to it.

* Other enforcement processes often expect you to have negotiated in good faith before escalating (for example, a court is likely to require mediation be attempted before hearing a case).","* Relies on genuine engagement and willingness of parties to resolve issues.

* Facilitators may not have an adequate skillset for resolving complex intellectual property disputes.

* Outcomes may not be as easily enforceable as court or tribunal decisions, especially when parties have not clearly indicated that the outcome of the mediation is to be legally binding.",,,"Anybody who is a party to a dispute.
Mediation generally requires engagement from both parties to the dispute, though some mediation providers will allow a single party to submit a unilateral request for mediation and then encourage the other party to participate in mediation.",,,"Possible outcomes include:
* One party does not agree to engage in mediation

* Parties successfully negotiate and reach an agreement to resolve a dispute with help from a mediator

* Parties unable to reach an agreement and withdraw from the mediation process, with the possibility of one or more parties escalating the matter to other dispute resolution processes."
Dxxxx,,,,,,,,,
D1022,World IP Organisation (WIPO) ,"While this varies depending on the ADR process used, ADR generally offers the following benefits over dispute resolution through the court system:
* Costs are lower than court proceedings - particularly in the case of complex international disputes.

* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.

* Offers broader and more creative resolution solutions.

* Confidentiality, as decisions and records are not shared with the public.

* Less confrontational, helping both parties keep things from getting heated and can help preserve business relationships.

* If a dispute spans across multiple countries, a single ADR procedure can potentially resolve all the issues in one forum, saving time, reducing costs, and minimising the risk of inconsistent outcomes. Can have binding and enforceable outcomes in the form of a settlement contract or arbitral award.

* Arbitral decisions are final and cannot be appealed, unlike court rulings, while mediated settlements typically align with both parties' interests, preventing the likelihood of further dispute.

* Globally enforceable, whereas a court decision is typically confined to the jurisdiction of the country where the court is located. Using the WIPO Center's services has the additional benefits of:Procedural assistance so the process is easy to navigate and use. Simplifying international disputes that involve multiple jurisdictions and languages.","* Relies on genuine engagement and willingness of parties to work out an agreement.

* Without a binding agreement prior to the process, either party can withdraw from the process at any point in time, resulting in wasted time, money and effort.",,,"Anybody who is a party to a dispute. However, ADR options, including those provided by the WIPO Center, generally require engagement from both parties to the dispute. It can be easier to use their services if:
* Parties agree to resolve their dispute through the WIPO Center - However, the WIPO Center allows one party to initiate mediation by submittinga unilateral request for mediation.

* There is a contract in place whereby parties agree to resolve disputes through the WIPO Center. You might wish to consider includingADR clauses in your contractsin case you would like to resolve your future IP disputes with your business partners through ADR at the WIPO Center.",,,"Outcomes of ADR will depend on the specific type of ADR processes used. Possible outcomes include:
* Parties successfully negotiating and reaching an agreement to resolve a dispute.

* A binding decision such as an arbitral award or an enforceable settlement agreement.

* Further escalation into court litigation.

* Parties may withdraw from the ADR process prior to resolution of the dispute."

* If you have received a letter of demand (or cease and desist letter), the other party may expect a response within a set period of time: seeReceiving a letter of demand.

* If you are actually infringing the other party's IP rights and you continue to do so while you decide what to do, then your ongoing infringement (particularly after you were made aware) could result in the other party being able to claim additional compensation if they start legal action against you.",,,"* Anyone accused of infringing IP, particularly where the claim seems unfounded

* People who want time to gather evidence and obtain legal advice before making a move.",,Most businesses will take some time to evaluate the situation before deciding what to do.,"* The other party may give up and decide not to escalate the issue.

* The other party chooses to escalate the dispute.

E1004,Before applying,,,,,,,,
D1011,Guage the situation  ,"* The time, cost and labour required to take actions to prevent infringement on your IP may not be justified at this point in your business or IP journey.

* Taking no immediate action can allow you to gather evidence and time to evaluate the true risk and possible damage to your business, so you can act when the time is right.

* You can usually change your mind and pursue an action in future - you are not required to act as soon as you became aware of infringement, although delays could pose risks.

* Infringing businesses may fail or leave the market with no intervention from you.

* Choosing to avoid enforcement actions shelters you from needing to establish or defend your rights, which you may not wish to draw attention to.

* You can choose more opportune timing to take action, for example: when your business is impacted enough to warrant action, when you have gathered enough evidence to take effective action, or other practical timing issues relating to your business (like avoiding the busy season).","* Without professional advice, there is a risk that you will miss easy and effective enforcement options.

* Delaying taking enforcement actions may make them more difficult to pursue in the future.

* The cost and energy of monitoring the infringement in an ongoing way may exceed the effort of dealing with it immediately.

* If infringement has happened and you do not take action, the infringement may be repeated by the current infringer or others also infringing.

* Allowing infringement - even that which doesn't directly damage your business - may:affect public perception of your rightsundermine your entitlement to these rightsin extreme cases, leave you open to legal actions (such as cases where fake versions of a product pose a risk to customers).",,,Both large and small businesses use this strategy frequently - only pursuing enforcement when it is necessary.,,,"* The consequences of infringement remain (or become) insignificant.

* The consequences of infringement increase, and you re-evaluate your stance on enforcement."
E1007,Checking IP rights ,,,,,,,,
B1014,Negotiation,"This option offers a lower cost, flexible and private way to resolve IP disputes. A negotiated commercial solution offers:
* Potentially lower costs and a quicker process, especially compared to other dispute resolution processes where you must rely on third parties (such as courts and tribunals).

* The ability to agree to a creative, productive outcome that can benefit both parties commercially.

* A much less adversarial pathway than legal procedures, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party.

* A flexible and informal approach, as it is entirely up to the parties to shape the process.

* Negotiation can be conducted across multiple jurisdictions.

* Confidentiality, as the details of negotiation and the resulting agreements reached are generally not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.","* Relies on genuine engagement and willingness of parties to resolve issues.

* If the discussion stalls or backfires, this could result in delays or lost opportunities.

* Outcomes may not be as easily enforceable as court or tribunal decisions, especially when parties have not clearly indicated that the outcome of the negotiation is to be legally binding.

* In some cases, direct contact may worsen tensions. If the other party considers that you are posing unreasonable aggressive or unprofessional terms for negotiation (not negotiating in good faith), it may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply. Some commercial arrangements may result in your intellectual property being 'diluted' by sharing the same or similar IP with others, which may cause damage to the value of your IP and make it harder to enforce it in the future.

* If not handled with caution, it is possible that you may say something that undermines your legal position, which could result in less favourable outcomes if formal action follows.",,,Any party to an IP dispute willing to engage in good faith dialogue. Some businesses choose to use commercial negotiation even when they are unsure whether infringement has occurred.,,Commercial negotiation is a routine strategy used by businesses in a range of situations.,"Commercial negotiations can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the parties' desires and specific circumstances. If you are able to reach an agreed outcome, this might result in:
* A licence or co-existence arrangement,

* Selling or transferring IP ownership (calledassignment),

* Compensation or goodwill payment,

* Franchising options, or

* Mutual agreement to stop or change the disputed conduct.

E1006,Using IP in business,,,,,,,,
D1016,Opposition process,"* A successful opposition weakens the other party's rights to the trade mark that is allegedly being copied or used without permission.

* Trade mark opposition and hearing processes are more informal and generally quicker than court proceedings in reaching an outcome.

* Hearing officers in IP Australia have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.

* The process is accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.

* The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.

* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.","* If your opposition is unsuccessful and the trade mark proceeds to registration, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.

* When opposing the registration of a trade mark, the applicant will be notified of your opposition. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the other party be aware of your actions.

* Due to the public nature of these procedures there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to take an enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy.

* There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.

* Using these procedures improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.

* If you are successful in opposing registration of a trade mark, the denied applicant may appeal the decision to court.

* If you lose, the other party may refer to that decision in their infringement claim, though Courts are not bound by IP Australia's decisions.

* The other party may still take court action during the process.",,,Any person can oppose accepted trade marks within the opposition period.,,"Between 1% - 3% of trade marks whose acceptance is advertised are opposed. This currently equates to around 2,000 oppositions to registration per year.","* IP Australia refuses the application and the trade mark does become registered.

* The applicant narrows or amends thegoods and services specified in thetrade markapplication, and it proceeds in a reduced form.

* The oppositionto registering the trade mark is dismissedand the trade markis registered without changes.

If you are found to have made an unjustified threat it could expose you to public scrutiny, negative publicity or reputational damage.

* Undergoing a formal dispute resolution process may undermine existing or future business relationships with the other party.

* If either party is unhappy with the decision of the panel, they can initiate legal proceedings.

Whether you have the right to the licence will depend on the dispute resolution policy.
When using the UDRP your trade mark can be registered anywhere in the world, including Australia.

* The disputed domain name licence(s) cancelled, in which case the domain name(s) will become available for registration by another eligible party.

* The disputed domain name licence(s) is transferred to you.

* The disputed domain name licence(s) remains with the current registrant.

* If the Panel finds that the complaint was brought in bad faith they will note in their decision that the complaint constitutes an abuse of the proceeding called 'reverse domain name hijacking'.

The re-examination process also allows for the submission of documents and supporting evidence from the challenging party, including citations which may not have been considered when the patent was examined.
One additional benefit of the re-examination process, is that it operates independently of the court system, meaning that it will not prejudice any subsequent litigation (i.e. it won't influence a judge in a court case). Note that re-examination decisions may be appealed to the Federal Court.","There are some risks associated with the patent re-examination process.
While the costs associated with a re-examination request are low, there is still the possibility that the challenging party will not be successful, and the patent will be maintained. Notably, the re-examination process also allows the patent holder to amend their claims; in some cases, allowing them to circumvent the grounds on which the patent was challenged.
Another significant risk associated with re-examination, is that the process is '

ex parte'

D1017,Patent opposition,"Patent oppositions provide a moderately cost-effective mechanism to challenge the validity of an Australian patent application. Additionally, the oppositions process is adversarial, meaning that you will have the opportunity to provide evidence and refute or reply to evidence provided by the opposition regarding the legal and/or factual arguments directed against the patent.
Additionally, the oppositions process takes place prior to the grant of the patent, potentially reducing the risk of commercial disputes arising from the grant of the patent.","* If your opposition action is unsuccessful and the patent is granted, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.

* When opposing the acceptance of a patent, the applicant will be informed of your opposition, as well as any documents or evidence provided (unless you notify IP Australia of the confidentiality requirement for some or all of the documents). You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the applicant be aware of you and access these materials.

* It is possible that filing an opposition may alert the other party to your claims and can cause them to act more defensively or even contest your own rights.

* Using this process improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.

* If you are late in providing evidence which you promised, late fees may be owed to IP Australia.",,,Anyone can oppose a patent.,,"Fewer than 300 per year (out of 30,000 patents filed each year)","There are three possible outcomes from the patent oppositions process,

C1007,IP Licensing,"Licensing your IP can offer several advantages:
* Generating income from ongoing royalty payments or a single lump-sum payment.

* Expanding into new markets without setting-up operations yourself.

* Retaining ownership while allowing others to use your IP.

* Depending on the licence you choose, you can allow others to use your IP but retain the right to use the IP yourself.

* Strengthening business relationships and opening up partnership opportunities.

* Leveraging another party's distribution, manufacturing or marketing capacity.

* Maintaining control through terms and restrictions in the agreement.

* Licences are incredibly flexible - you can choose what, where, when and how IP can be used.","Licensing your IP also comes with potential risks:
* Disputes can arise if the terms of the licence are not clear. Getting an IP professional to draft the licence can help to reduce this risk.

* You may need to monitor the licence agreement to ensure the other party complies with it.

* Licensing your IP rights to others has the potential to reduce the uniqueness or value of your IP depending on the circumstances, including who you license it to and the licensing terms.

* If youexclusivelylicense your IP rights, you will no longer be able to use them yourself.

* In specific instances regarding trade marks, if the licensor is unable to maintain effective controls over trade mark use, the trade mark can become vulnerable to removal for non-use.

* In the case a patent has been licensed to an exclusive licensee - they will have the right to commence infringement proceedings. In some cases, the patent holder can also be added as a party to those proceedings, potentially leading to legal action or expense.

* If you do not put in place arrangements to protect your sensitive commercial information (such as specific business practices or product features) during negotiations, it may be shared with other parties or misused by the recipient.

* You may also need to consider the potential tax implications of the licence, particularly if you are operating in multiple jurisdictions.",,,An IP rights owner and any other person with a right to sublicense IP rights (as long as that person complies with any restrictions that may apply to their right to sublicense those IP rights).,,It is very common for parties to commercialise their IP rights by licensing them to others.,"Outcomes of licensing investigations may include:

* You will be able to better distinguish yourself in the marketplace and lower the risk of confusion in the marketplace.

* The time, cost and labour required to take actions to avoid infringement on your IP may not be justified at this point in your business or IP journey.

* Choosing to avoid enforcement actions shelters you from needing to establish or defend your rights, which you may not wish to draw attention to.

* Additionally, clearly distinguishing yourself from competitors will help your customers avoid confusion, which may occur even if both parties have a registered right to use the trade mark.","* Without professional advice, there is a risk that you will miss easy and effective enforcement options.

* You may have a legal right to use the IP and will have given it up when you didn't have to; advice from an IP professional can help you determine this.

* Rebranding may not resolve the fundamental IP issue (e.g. you may believe that the new brand is different enough, but someone else could still consider itdeceptively similar, and thus grounds for challenging).

* You may lose some reputation/goodwill you may have built under your previous brand.

* Rebranding will not resolve any disputes about the design or the functional elements of your product(s).

* While rebranding does not necessarily require engagement with the other party, without engagement or agreement, you can't be assured the other party will not pursue enforcement actions (which may have occurred while using the previous brand).",,,Both large and small businesses use this strategy.,,One survey of 91 Australian small businesses found that 48% had to rebrand their business due to the inability to secure a trade mark.,"* The rebrand successfully avoids any potential conflicts and no further action is needed.

* It can a simple, fast and low-cost option when a registered trade mark in question. If your application to remove a trade mark on the basis of non-use is unopposed, your request will be actioned following the two-month opposition period.

* In about 60% of cases, removal applications will not lead to an adversarial process, as those who are genuinely not using their trade marks typically do not oppose the application for removal.

* This process is also accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.","* When applying to remove the other party's trade mark from the register on the basis of non-use, the owner of the trade mark will be notified of your application and details within one month of filing. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the other party be aware of your identity and actions.

* Due to the public nature of these procedures there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to submit an application to remove the other party's trade mark should be considered as part of your IP or brand protection strategy.

* Any person can oppose your request for removal within 2 months of the publishing date and tell IP Australia that they disagree that the trade mark has not been used. If you wish to respond to the opposition and establish that there is a case for removal based on non-use, this will lengthen the removal process and take up further cost, time and efforts.

* A party who is dissatisfied with IP Australia's decision can also appeal it to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART), or Federal Courtorthe FederalCircuit and FamilyCourt, which could be highly time-consuming and costly.",,,Any person can file an application for removal or cessation of protection of a trade mark for non-use.,,"IP Australia received approximately 1,000-1,500 applications annually for removal for non-use over the 5-year period of 2019-2024.","If the application for removal is advertised and no one opposes it within the required time:
* The trade mark will be completely removed from the Register, or

* The trade mark will partially be removed from the Register, namely in relation to the goods and services as specified in your application for removal.
If the other party opposes your request to remove their trade mark within the two-month opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition.
The person opposing the removal of the trade mark is required to establish, by filing evidence, that they have used the trade mark for the goods and services which are the subject of the removal application or that there are other circumstances justifying the non-use of the mark.
IP Australia will follow the processes prescribed in the law to decide the outcome, which could be any of the following:

* They have an in-depth knowledge of relevant legislation and industry practices surrounding IP in the relevant jurisdiction, with the ability to leverage both appropriately and proportionately.

* They are able to recognise common issues which come up and refer you to other professionals when needed.","* Failing to respond appropriately to accusations of overseas infringement can reduce your entitlement to some kinds of IP in overseas markets, your existing market presence and potential for future expansion.

* If you do not respond appropriately to accusations of infringement in foreign jurisdictions, there is a risk of having a court decision against you in the relevant jurisdiction, which may then be enforceable in Australia, jeopardising your interests and market position in the domestic market as well.

* Parties agree to resolve their dispute through ADR. However, some ADR providers allow one party to initiate an ADR process even without agreement from the other party.

* There is a contract in place whereby parties agree to resolve disputes through ADR. You might wish to consider including ADR clauses in your contracts in case you would like to resolve any future IP disputes with your business partners through ADR.",,,"Outcomes of ADR will depend on the specific type of ADR processes used. Possible outcomes include:
* Parties successfully negotiating and reaching an agreement to resolve a dispute

* A binding decision such as an arbitral award or an enforceable agreement

* Further escalation into more formal dispute resolution processes such as litigation or administrative hearings

* Parties may withdraw from the ADR process prior to resolution of the dispute."
D1005,Court - Trade mark,"* If you succeed, a court can award damages or compensation for losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made by an infringer through their infringement).

* Court decisions are binding and enforceable.

* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.

* You can often resolve several related matters in one case.

* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.

* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.

* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage the other party to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid the court proceedings continuing.

* For infringement claims, a court can, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent the other party from continuing to infringe your IP rights.","* The outcome can be unpredictable.

* While a court can determine matters of law, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.

* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you.

* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties if you are wholly (or partially) unsuccessful.

* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you.

* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful and time-consuming and distract from the operation of your business

* Court proceedings are usually public, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.

* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.

* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.

* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).

* You may not be able to bring a legal claim if you have agreed in a contract that you will use, or that you will first try, an alternative form of dispute resolution.",,,"For infringement actions, the owner of the registered trade mark usually starts the infringement action. However, an exclusive licensee or authorised user may also hold the right to start an action.
Other court actions can generally be taken by any aggrieved party with a relevant interest in the matter.",,"Trade mark proceedings are not particularly common in Australia because they can be expensive and time consuming for the parties involved. However, they are more common than some other types of intellectual property disputes like patent proceedings.
In the 2023-24 financial year, there were 77 trade mark filings in the Federal Court of Australia

Some trade mark proceedings are also started in State/Territory courts.","here are a wide range of possible outcomes, and these will also depend on the type of court action you might take. Some possible outcomes are:
* You might reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.

* The other party might not respond or participate in the court proceedings, in which case the court might decide in your favour.

* The other party's trade mark registration might be cancelled, removed or amended.

* The court might decide against you, in which case your trade mark registration could be cancelled, removed or amended and you may need to pay some or all of the other party's legal costs.

* You could be awarded damages or compensation.

* A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your IP rights - including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter (seeSeek an urgent injunction).

* A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.

* Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims forpassing offor under the Australian Consumer Law).
In most cases, the outcome can be appealed to a higher court."
D1036,International disputes,"* In most cases, engaging a legal professional is likely to reduce the risks you may encounter in enforcing your IP rights in another country.

* Legal professionals can provide a wide range of legal services and develop a holistic IP enforcement strategy suited to your IP and business goals.

* They have the knowledge, training and experience in their country to guide you through a dispute or a conflict which can be highly stressful and draining.

* They have an in-depth knowledge of relevant international legislation and industry practices, with the ability to leverage both appropriately and proportionately.

* They are bound by codes of conduct, professional standards and ethical obligations to act in your best interests, stay away from conflicts of interests and unethical conduct.

* They can recognise common issues which come up and refer you to other professionals and services you may not be aware of.","* It can be complicated to enforce your IP overseas, which can cause pressure on you and your business.

* Outcomes and costs can be less predictable in some jurisdictions than they would be in Australia.

* Some legal professionals have different specialties and may be more effective in their particular field of expertise. For instance, one lawyer may be highly experienced in dealing with multi-national trade marks, but not so experienced with patent licencing deals, or vice versa.

* Once you engage a legal professional for their service, they are obliged to follow your instructions. While they can advise you on certain courses of action, you have the ultimate decision. Using a legal professional can lead to a false sense of security if you do not understand and pay heed to their advice.",,,,,,
D1006,Mediation ,"* Costs and duration of the process is generally quite low.

* Mediation can be conducted across different jurisdictions.

* Less adversarial than other procedures such as arbitration and court proceedings, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party by reducing emotional strain and preventing the discussions from being too heated.

* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.

* Parties can narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides.

* Offers broad, productive or creative solutions to issues.

* Confidentiality, as the details of mediation and the resulting agreements reached are not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.

* Following a mediation outcome, it is open to the parties to the mediation to take further steps between them. This can include entering into a legally binding agreement that incorporates some or all of the outcomes from the mediation, provided the parties clearly intend and agree to it.

* Other enforcement processes often expect you to have negotiated in good faith before escalating (for example, a court is likely to require mediation be attempted before hearing a case).","* Relies on genuine engagement and willingness of parties to resolve issues.

* Facilitators may not have an adequate skillset for resolving complex intellectual property disputes.

* Outcomes may not be as easily enforceable as court or tribunal decisions, especially when parties have not clearly indicated that the outcome of the mediation is to be legally binding.",,,"Anybody who is a party to a dispute.
Mediation generally requires engagement from both parties to the dispute, though some mediation providers will allow a single party to submit a unilateral request for mediation and then encourage the other party to participate in mediation.",,,"Possible outcomes include:
* One party does not agree to engage in mediation

* Parties successfully negotiate and reach an agreement to resolve a dispute with help from a mediator

* Parties unable to reach an agreement and withdraw from the mediation process, with the possibility of one or more parties escalating the matter to other dispute resolution processes."
D1002,Notice of Objection,"* Provides a way to intercept infringing imports before they enter the Australian market.

* Acts as a deterrent for anyone who tries to import goods that infringe on your trade marks.

* When caught, the vast majority of infringing importers abandon their goods.

* No financial cost to lodge the Notice itself.","* You must agree to pay for costs incurred by the ABF which might result from the seizure of potentially infringing goods. Generally, costs are minimal.

* Failure to identify importers within your own supply chain may result in the seizure of your own imported goods.

* This action does not permanently resolve the issue of your goods being counterfeited.

* It doesn't take much for matters to escalate to court, potentially introducing higher risks and costs.

* Escalation of the dispute could require you to defend/reaffirm your claim to your IP rights.",,,"* Owners of registered trade marks which claim goods (services are not eligible for the scheme).

* Authorised users or importers of a trade mark, with the registered trade mark owner's permission.

* Copyright owners of copyright material.",,More than 500 trade mark notices and 41 copyright notices are currently in force.,"* The goods/copies are not detected entering Australia, or goods are detected but cannot be verified as potentially infringing; you are not notified.

* The goods/copies are seized entering Australia. You and the importer are informed.
The importer may then:
* choose to abandon the goods/copies, which are then disposed of by the ABF, or

* file a Claim for Release of Seized goods/copies form.
If they submit this form, one of two things can happen:
* youdo notbegin legal proceedings within 10 days and the goods are released to the importer, or

* you begin legal proceedings within 10 days.
The court's decision will likely result in either:
* the ABF disposing of the goods, or

* the goods being released back to the importer."
B1005,Apply for a trade mark,"Registering a trade mark offers a range of benefits which can simplify the process of defending your IP rights. It provides:
* Formal registered rights that may support your defence against alleged infringement (on the specific types of goods and services claimed in the application).

* Robust and universally recognised registration (within Australia).

* Clear evidence of ownership date to support your claims.

* Strong negotiating position for future discussions to resolve the dispute.","* Applications to register a trade mark are generally public (an exception is the early stages of TM Headstart). Your competitors might become aware you are trying to register your trade mark. They may take actions like trying to register their own similar trade mark, or oppose your application.

* Examiner objections may incur additional fees or require amendments which may compromise your branding in relation to the scope of goods and services the trade mark can claim or (in case of TM Headstart) its visual identity.

* You might discover that there is a problem with your trade mark, or that someone else has already registered a similar trade mark. This could mean you need to reconsider whether your trade mark is right for you.

* An Australian trade mark registration does not cover you in overseas markets.

* Registration does not apply retroactively to past use, so it may not resolve allegations of infringement before you applied.",,,,,"There are over 800,000 registered trade marks on the 

Australia Trade MarkRegister.",
D1029,Arbitration ,"* The potential outcome(s) of arbitration are highly enforceable, as Australia is a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards ('the New York Convention'). Australia has implemented the New York Convention throughInternational Arbitration Act 1974(Cth) and through uniform State and Territory statutes governing domestic arbitration.

* Arbitration can be conducted across different jurisdictions and arbitral awards are often comparatively easier to enforce in foreign jurisdictions under the New York Convention, which is an advantage over court proceedings for cross-border disputes.

* Parties can choose their arbitrator/s and have some flexibility and control over shaping the process (for example, through scheduling, rules of evidence and procedures).

* Parties can narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides.

* Parties can also choose arbitrators with sector-specific expertise in relation to the subject matter of the IP dispute, which may be preferable when the dispute concerns highly technical issues.

* The details and outcome of arbitration can be kept confidential, subject to the parties' agreement, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.

* Arbitration may offer a faster and more cost-effective alternative to court proceedings.","* Arbitral awards are generally final with limited grounds for appeal, which can be a risk if the decision is unfavourable.

* In some cases, arbitration can become as expensive as court proceedings, particularly if complex IP issues require specialised arbitrators.

* The outcome of arbitration can be unpredictable as arbitration does not necessarily follow the rules of procedure and evidence applicable in court proceedings.

* Arbitral awards do not automatically set alegal precedent; the ruling of the arbitrator/s will apply to the parties to the dispute only.",,,"Anybody who is a party to a dispute.
Who's involved?
* Parties to the disputes.

* Arbitrator(s), whose role is to hear both parties and make a ruling.

* (Optional) Legal representation for one or more of the participants.

* (Optional) Experts giving evidence for the arbitrator to consider.",,"IP Australia does not have oversight over arbitration but it is reported that there were 27 international arbitration cases involving Australian disputants in 2023, though not all of these relate to IP disputes.","There are a wide range of possible outcomes, including but not limited to:
* If parties to a dispute agree to resolve their dispute via arbitration, the arbitrator will make a ruling through an arbitral award at the conclusion of the process.

* Parties might reach a negotiated settlement prior to the arbitrator making an award and withdraw from the process.

* In some rare cases, the arbitral award can be subject to further court proceedings due to factors such as lack of validity in the arbitration agreement or the dispute concerning non-arbitrable subject matter."
D1030,Interim court injuction order,"* Rapid cessation of infringement. By halting any infringement immediately, you prevent further damage to your IP, such as erosion of market share or brand reputation.

* Increased leverage in negotiations. The court's willingness to grant an urgent injunction sends a powerful signal to the defendant, which may affect future negotiations.

* Preservation of evidence. An urgent injunction often comes with additional orders that can include the preservation of documents, files or infringing stock.

* Enforceability. There are existing mechanisms in place to ensure people comply with court orders.","* Potential to pay damages. If it later turns out the injunction was unjustified, the applicant may need to compensate the defendant.

* Evidence threshold. While the threshold for an urgent injunction is lower than for a final decision, you still need strong evidence outlining both the infringement and the urgency of the matter.

* Escalation. Seeking an injunction is a serious escalation of a conflict and may make it difficult or use other enforcement actions in future. Additionally, filing an interim injunction requires you to take further actions in court.",,,"Interim injunctions are available for many matters. For IP infringement actions, you'll usually need to clearly own an IP right.",,"In 2024 the Federal Court heard 5 applications for interlocutory injunctions in IP matters, only 2 were granted.","* If the interim injunction is granted, the defending party must cease all activity suspected of infringing.

* This can be extended throughout the trial as an 'interlocutory injunction'. If the subsequent lawsuit is ruled in your favour, the defendant might then face a final, permanent injunction.

* If the subsequent lawsuit is ruled in favour of the defendant, you may be required to compensate the defendant for lost revenue due to the interim injunction. Additionally, you may be liable for subsequent legal costs, and the defendant is free to continue their previous activities.

* If the interim injunction is not granted, the defendant can continue their activities.

* If you continue taking court action for infringement/with the subsequent lawsuit, an injunction or damages may be granted at a later stage."
C1006,Educate your customers ,"* Helps customers choose your product over confusing or inferior copies.

* Supports your brand positioning and long-term customer loyalty.

* Makes suspected infringement easier to detect and explain.

* Can reduce the incentive for others to copy your product if consumers avoid fakes.

* May already align with your existing marketing and advertising spend.

* Non-confrontational way to respond when you suspect copying.

* Can diversify your business' sources of value outside of reliance on registered IP alone.","* Careless wording may be seen as an attack on a competitor.

* Poorly designed campaigns might confuse or alienate customers.

* May have limited impact if not paired with broader brand strategy.",,,"* This approach is most applicable for business that offer products or services to the public.

* Particularly worth considering for businesses that face pervasive copycat or counterfeit issues.",,"Most businesses try to educate customers about their brand through advertising, customer outreach, blogs, social media content and more. Helping customers recognise and value registered IP can be one aim of this education but is rarely the main focus.","There are few easily-measurable outcomes from customer education. These may include:
* Customers become better at identifying and choosing your genuine products.

* Reduced sales of counterfeit or lookalike products.

* For trade marks particularly, stronger recognition in the market may strengthen future enforcement efforts."
101-7,Infringement 101,,,,,,,,
B1006,Opposition process,"* Defending your application from opposition prevents your application from lapsing automatically and gives you opportunities to present your argument and evidence as to why the application meets the requirements for registration.

* Trade mark opposition and hearing processes are less formal and generally quicker than court proceedings in reaching an outcome.

* The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.

* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.

* Hearing officers have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.

* The unsuccessful party may be required to pay the costs incurred by the other party during the opposition process. This does not, however, extend to commercial losses or damages.","* If your defence is unsuccessful or if you choose not to defend, your trade mark might fail to proceed to registration or might need to be amended in order to be registrable.

* You might be required to pay the other party's costs.

* Due to the public nature of this process there is a risk of public scrutiny, negative publicity or reputational damage.

* If you decide to defend, you are choosing to engage with an administrative process with various stages of paperwork and requirements, each with deadlines and consequences for failing to meet the deadline. Failing to meet specific timeframes and submit documents and evidence in acceptable formats can jeopardise your defence.

* Even if you are successful, the opponent can appeal the decision and take the matter to court. This will occur additional expenses.",,,A trade mark applicant whose application has been opposed.,,"Between 1% - 3% of marks whose acceptance is advertised are opposed. This currently equates to around 2,000 oppositions to registration per year.","* Your trade mark achieving registration as applied for if your defence is upheld, orThe opposition being upheld, and your trade mark fails to achieve registration, orIt is also possible that the opposition was only raised in relation to part of the goods and services claimed under the trade mark, or the hearing officer considers that your defence or the other party's opposition is only partially established. In this case, your trade mark may still achieve registration for part of the goods and services you have specified in your application. The opponent withdraws or abandons the opposition, including if you reach a settlement or the matter resolves commercially before a final decision is made.

* You withdraw your trade mark application.

* If you choose not to defend your application against the opposition, your application will lapse."

* You may not need to identify or track down the infringer yourself.

* Being able to reduce infringement and prevent sales being diverted by addressing infringement on a major sales channel.","* Due to the one-off nature of this process there is a risk that the counterfeiters/infringers can return in the future. You will usually need to continuously monitor for reoccurrence.

* Online platforms can only take down infringing products or content from their platforms, and do not have power to stop the infringing behaviour itself.

* The outcome of the action can be somewhat unpredictable, as platforms will have different set of rules and procedures in dealing with complaints.",,,"Some mechanisms offered by platforms may require you to be a seller or user with a valid account.

* Legal Support:IP insurance providers often have specialised legal networks or resources to help manage and defend claims effectively.

* Investor Confidence:Holding IP insurance can reassure potential investors and partners that risks associated with IP disputes are managed.

* Predictable Costs:While the excess you may need to pay before insurance takes over can be high, it is a known amount which can be planned for.","* Coverage limitations and exclusions:Like all insurance, IP insurance policies can be complex, with narrowly defined terms and exclusions - certain types of IP may not be fully covered. Additionally, insurers typicallydo not cover disputes or infringements that are already known, in progress or on the horizon.

* Insurer control over litigation strategy:When a claim arises, the insurance company may want to settle quickly to minimise costs, even if you would prefer to continue to fight the claim. In some cases, this can lead to a conflict between the insurer's cost-control objectives and your business goals. Additionally, some policies will require you to use the insurer's panel of approved attorneys - which may make it difficult or more costly to use your own preferred IP counsel (if you already have one in mind).",,,"Given that IP insurance is marketed towards IP holders, any party holding or in the process of attaining IP can make use of IP insurance, although most commercial insurance products are directed towards trade marks or patents.",,"As the visibility of IP insurance is fairly low, it is difficult to estimate how widely it is used, although popularity has fluctuated in the past.
Additionally, insurance products have often been expensive, meaning the costs and limitations of specific insurance products often act as a barrier to those considering it.","There can be both positive and negative outcomes from IP insurance.
Positives:
* Financial protectionin IP disputes, covering costly legal fees and potential damages or settlements.

* Improved enforcementof your intellectual property, as insurance may help fund actions against infringers.

* Credibility boost, offering reassurance to investors, partners, or stakeholders.

* Stronger negotiating positionwhen resolving disputes.
Negatives:
* High deductibles (excess)may apply before insurance kicks in.

* Premiums may increaseafter making a claim.

* Coverage limitationsdepending on the policy terms - not all types of disputes or jurisdictions may be included.

* Insurer influence- the insurance company might want a say in your legal strategy.

* Risk of declined coverageif the insurer determines the issue isn't covered.

* False sense of security, leading to overreliance and mistaken belief that ""everything is covered."""

* Publication reveals your design to competitors, which may prompt challenges or copying overseas.

* You cannot enforce the right until it is certified, so extra examination fees and time may apply.

* If your claims are unfounded, such as commencing enforcing based on an uncertified design right, alleged infringers may commence legal proceedings for unjustified threats.

* Failing to renew after five years (including the six‑month grace period) will cause the registration to cease and the design enters the public domain.",,,Any individual or business that creates a new and distinctive design.,,"In 2023/2024 financial year, 8,776 designs were registered, and 1,540 designs were certified.","* The design is registered and later certified, giving you enforceable rights.

* Allows you to consider many options to escalate, if suspected infringement continues.

* Other enforcement processes often expect you to take genuine steps to resolve a dispute before escalating.","* Making an unjustified threat that you will start legal action against another person for IP infringement can result in liability for compensation, damages and costs resulting from the threat and in you being ordered to stop making the threat.

* Using unreasonably aggressive or unprofessional tone in the communication with the other party may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply.

* Alerting the other party, regardless of the legitimacy of your claim, can expose you counterclaims or actions from the other party, which may escalate the conflict in an unwanted way. This could jeopardise your IP rights.

* For registered rights, it might prompt the other party to challenge the validity or registrability of your IP right in an attempt to undermine your claims.

* In the case of trade marks, the other party may apply for a trade mark as a defensive strategy against your claims, and you may then need to decide if you wish to oppose their application.

* Contacting the suspected infringer might give them time to hide or destroy evidence. This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, you should seek legal advice before communicating with the other party.

* Depending on what you say to the other party, or what you might agree with them, this could impact your ability to take other enforcement action in future. It is usually prudent to tell the other party that any informal communications are on a 'without prejudice' basis and to include this in any written communications with them.",,,Someone who owns IP (or in limited cases authorised user) and can provide evidence of their rights.,,,"Informal communication with the other party can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the specific circumstances.
Some possible outcomes are:
* The alleged infringing behaviour stops following the conversation, especially if the other party was simply unaware of existing IP rights.

* The alleged infringer does not change their behaviour, in which case you may have to consider other enforcement options.

* Parties can engage in further communication disputing part or all of your claims.

* The alleged infringer is placed on notice that their conduct may involve infringement, which may assist you to seek monetary compensation if you later commence court action.

* The conflict can further escalate into more serious, formal dispute settlement procedures (for example, sending a letter of demand, litigation, mediation, arbitration, administrative hearings.).

* The other party may not fulfil all the requirements but may be willing to participate in some form of negotiation.

* The other party may commence proceedings challenging the validity of the IP right, or be prompted to take legal action against you (for instance if they are of the opinion that you are infringing on their rights). This could include seeking damages or compensation for unjustified threats."

D1087,Court - Designs,"* If you succeed, a court can award damages or compensation for losses and costs (including, in some cases, an account of profits made in relation to the infringement).

* Court decisions are binding and enforceable between the parties to the proceedings.

* The other party cannot simply ignore your legal claim without consequences.

* You can often resolve several related matters in one case.

* Court can take into consideration a wide range of legal factors which may fall outside the scope of other decision-making bodies such as IP Australia's Opposition and Hearing processes.

* Court proceedings allow cross-examination of evidence and expert witnesses, which could be helpful for prosecuting your argument if you have a highly technical case.

* The gravity, expense, publicity and protracted nature of court proceedings can encourage the other party to negotiate or engage in other forms of dispute resolution to settle legal claims and avoid the court proceedings continuing.

* For suspected infringement claims, a court can, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent the other party from continuing to infringe your registered design.","* The outcome can be unpredictable.

* While a court can determine the dispute between the parties, it may not be in the best interests of your business. Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.

* The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you, including challenges to the validity of your design.

* On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties.

* The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you. This can have implications for any costs you may incur.

* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful, time-consuming, and distract from the operation of your business.

* Court proceedings are usually public unless they are covered by a confidentiality order, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.

* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.

* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.

* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).

* If you intend to commence proceedings against a party that you have a pre-existing contractual agreement with, it may be important to consider whether the agreement covers ways to deal with IP disputes. For example, some agreements may require a party try forms of alternative dispute resolution before they are able to commence proceedings",,,"For infringement actions, the owner of the certified design right usually starts the infringement action. However, an exclusive licensee may also hold the right to start an action. 

Other court actions can generally be taken by any aggrieved party with a relevant interest in the matter.",,There are very few designs related court cases. Most years there are no designs proceedings.,"There are a wide range of possible outcomes, and these will also depend on the type of court action you might take. Some possible outcomes are:
* You might reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.

* The other party might not respond or participate in the court proceedings, in which case the court might decide in your favour.

* The other party's registered design might be cancelled or amended.

* The court might decide against you, in which case your registered design could be cancelled and you may need to pay some or all of the other party's legal costs.

* You could be awarded damages.

* A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your design rights - including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter.

* A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.

* Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims under the Australian Consumer Law).

* In most cases, the outcome can be appealed to a higher court."

* A focus on practical, non-punitive outcomes.

* Fair opportunity for both parties to present their case in writing.

* There is no compensation for loss or damages, meaning this process is less adversarial.","* auDA does not have an appeals process if you are unhappy with the decision of the panel. If you are unsatisfied with the outcome, either party can initiate legal proceedings against the other.

* Decisions made by the auDRP panel are made public. If you are found to have made an unjustified threat it could expose you to public scrutiny, negative publicity or reputational damage.

* Undergoing a formal dispute resolution process may undermine existing or future business relationships with the other party.",,,Anyone with competing legal rights to a .au domain name licence (including the ownership of a relevant trade mark).,,"Of the 48 auDRP cases reviewed in financial year 2023-24, 22 resulted in the transfer of the .au domain name licence to the entity that initiated the review.","Three outcomes are possible following the panel's decision:
* The disputed .au domain name licence/s cancelled, in which case the .au domain name/s will become available for registration by another eligible member of the public.

B1015,Enforcing to defend ,"The benefits of enforcing your own IP as a response to another infringement action will vary depending on the nature of the infringement and the strength of your IP. In general, some of the strengths of this action are:

* Taking a proactive step may help you in later negotiations or mediations.

* It can help speed up the dispute if the other party is disingenuous.","The inherent risks of this action will vary depending on the nature of the infringement and the strength of your IP. In general, some of the risks of this action are:
* Attempts to enforce a non-valid or non-relevant right can expose someone to legal issues such as unjustified threats (for more information, please seeUnjustifiedThreats).

* Trying to enforce a non-valid IP right will likely require a large investment without the possibility of a return.

* Attempting to enforce a right that is not valid will likely increase the damages levied against the losing party in a successful IP enforcement action.
Attempting to enforce your IP in response to an enforcement action can be a strategic decision, however you should 

strongly consider

the relative strength and validity of the IP rights in question. You may wish to consider speaking to an IP lawyer or IP attorney before taking this course of action.",,,"We have not provided an indication of who can use this option guide because it encompasses a variety of situations.
However, making a counter-action against an accusation of infringement is a serious matter, and must have a genuine basis. Before responding with an enforcement action or a counter-action, it is worth being aware that using this option can sometimes result in 

serious legal consequences",,"IP rights holders can choose to enforce their IP rights through a wide range of enforcement options with varying degrees of specialisation, features and prevalence. Some enforcement options are, by nature, more accessible than others that require more time, commitment and effort.","The outcomes of enforcing your IP depend heavily on your individual circumstances, the type of IP rights involved and the enforcement pathway you take.

* May provide further surety to investors, licensees and customers over the validity and value of your intellectualproperty.","* Examination could lead to you needing to amend your registered design.

* Examination could lead to your registered design being revoked.

* Failing to pay your share of the examination fee (when examination is requested by a third party) will cause your registration to cease.

* A certificate of examination related to a registered design does not guarantee success; enforcing a design may still be costly.",,,"* The registered design owner or an exclusive licensee who wants to enforce the right.

Even where parties decide to take more formal enforcement action, they will often continue to seek to resolve their dispute through negotiations to avoid the time and expense of enforcement action.","Commercial negotiations can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the parties' desires and specific circumstances. Some popular forms of commercial arrangements involving IP include:
Licensing
You can agree to a licensing agreement. Licensing involves the owner of the IP or someone else with a right to licence the IP (the licensor) giving someone else (the licensee) permission to use - but not own - their IP usually in exchange for payment. For detailed information on types of licences and licence conditions, see 

How To Licence My IP | IP Australia

.
Assignment (selling or transferring your IP)
You may decide to sell your IP as part of your negotiation with the other party. This involves transferring the ownership of the IP to another entity (the assignee) through a process called 'assignment' so that you no longer have the rights to use the IP.
Once assignment is completed, you won't have any control over the IP asset you have sold unless you have agreed that the assignee licence some rights back to you. The assignee will bear the risk of commercial development of the IP and be responsible for all costs, including renewal fees paid to IP Australia.
Once the title of a registered IP right has been assigned through a contractual agreement, the transfer of the ownership can be recorded on the IP Australia register through IP Australia's

Online Services portal

.
Franchising (trade marks)
In a franchise agreement, you can give one or more parties (the franchisees) the right to use your trade mark or trade name, your business systems and processes, and so on.
The licensed rights are typically used by the franchisees to provide goods or services to agreed specifications. In return, they pay royalties and fees. Franchisees often contribute to marketing costs for the brand as well. Franchising is a highly regulated area of law and you should consult with a franchising expert such as a franchising lawyer before agreeing to a franchising agreement

.
Letter of consent or co-existence agreement (trade marks)
Trade mark owners can negotiate to have their trade marks co-exist in the market. This can allow both parties to use potentially conflicting rights in ways that both agree to (such as in certain geographical areas).
Trade mark co-existence agreements may take the form a formal contract stipulating rights and obligations of both parties, or a letter of consent where a party gives the other party (often in the form of

a letter

* The process is accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.

* The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.

* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.","* If your opposition is unsuccessful and the trade mark proceeds to registration, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.

* When opposing the registration of a trade mark, the applicant will be notified of your opposition. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the other party be aware of your actions.

* Due to the public nature of these procedures there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to take an enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy.

* There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.

* Using these procedures improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.

* If you are successful in opposing registration of a trade mark, the denied applicant may appeal the decision to court.

* If you lose, the other party may refer to that decision in their infringement claim, though Courts are not bound by IP Australia's decisions.

* The other party may still take court action during the process.",,,Any person can oppose accepted trade marks within the opposition period.,,"Between 1% - 3% of trade marks whose acceptance is advertised are opposed. This currently equates to around 2,000 oppositions to registration per year.","* IP Australia refuses the application and the trade mark does become registered.

* The applicant narrows or amends thegoods and services specified in thetrade markapplication, and it proceeds in a reduced form.

* The oppositionto registering the trade mark is dismissedand the trade markis registered without changes.

* Can demonstrate to investors and partners that you have a clear understanding and control over your IP.

* Can provide strategic insights to maximise commercial use of your IP.","* May require specialised expertise, which can add complexity or cost.

* One-off audits can become outdated - regular reviews are usually needed.",,,Any IP rights holder or authorised user managing IP assets.,,Conducting a one-off or regular IP audit is a practice commonly used by businesses that own or use multiple IP assets.,"Possible outcomes of an IP audit would depend heavily on factors such as the scope of the IP portfolio being audited, commercial strategies surrounding your business and the quality of the IP rights involved.
Noting that outcomes may vary heavily, possible outcomes of an IP audit can include, but are not limited to:
* A comprehensive IP register showing a record of IP assets that your business owns or has permission to use, the relevant IP owners and renewal dates

* Clear list of possible infringement risks and how to handle them

* Decision to get ongoing help from an IP professional."
B1007,Opposition process,"* Gives you a formal chance to defend your patent.

* You can make changes to your claims to overcome objections.

* If successful, your patent is more likely to stand up to future challenges.

* A Delegatewith significant experience in both IP law and the specific technical area, not a judge, makes the decision-this may be less intimidating while still providing a confident decision.

* The process helps clarify the strength of your patent early on.

* You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.","* If you do not engage or are unsuccessful in defending the opposition, you may lose some or all of your patent rights.

* Preparing evidence and submissions takes time and money.

* The opponent may raise issues that prompt a re-consideration of your whole patent.

IP Australia's Patent Opposition and Hearing Section published 54 decisions in 2024 and 66 decisions in 2023.,"There are four possible outcomes to your patent being opposed

:
* The opposition is dismissed and your patent is granted, unchanged.

* The opposition is successful, the Delegate revokes your patent altogether.

* The opposition is successful, and the Delegate decides that it is possible to modify your patent (e.g. narrowing the claims).

101-4,Infringement 101,,,,,,,,
D1015,Trade mark non-use action,"Simple, fast and low-cost (when unopposed)
Removal application can be a simple, fast and low-cost option when a registered trade mark in question has not been used in the marketplace for a considerable period of time, or when the owner of a trade mark does not use or intend to use the trade mark in good faith.
If your application to remove a trade mark on the basis of non-use is unopposed, your request will be actioned following the two-month opposition period.
* In about 60% of cases, removal applications will not lead to an adversarial process, as those who are genuinely not using their trade marks typically do not oppose the application for removal.","Escalation into further opposition process or court proceedings
After an application for removal has been filed and published, any person can oppose it within 2 months of the publishing date and tell IP Australia that they disagree that the trade mark has not been used. If you wish to respond to the opposition and establish that there is a case for removal based on non-use, this will lengthen the removal process and take up further cost, time and efforts.
A party who is dissatisfied with IP Australia's decision can also appeal it to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court of Australia, which could be highly time-consuming and costly.
Exposure resulting from notification and publication
The owner and their representative of the trade mark which is subject to a removal procedure will be notified of your application to remove the trade mark. This notification happens within one month of filing the application. A copy of the application will be forwarded with the notification, which will include your details and the details of your filing.
IP Australia also must give notice of the application for removal by publishing it on the Australian Trade Marks Search ('the Register'). This means that other parties would be aware of your identity and also your attempt to remove the trade mark from the Register. This may trigger the other party to oppose your application or initiate other forms of action (i.e. administrative hearings, court proceedings, etc.) against you and/or your business.",,,Any person can file an application for removal or cessation of protection of a trade mark for non-use.,,"IP Australia received approximately 1,000-1,500 applications annually for removal for non-use over the 5-year period of 2019-2024.","If the application for removal is advertised and no one opposes it within the required time:
* The trade mark will be completely removed from the Register, or

* The trade mark will partially be removed from the Register, namely in relation to the goods and services as specified in your application for removal.
If the other party opposes your request to remove their trade mark within the two-month opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition.
The person opposing the removal of the trade mark is required to establish, by filing evidence, that they have used the trade mark for the goods and services which are the subject of the removal application or that there are other circumstances justifying the non-use of the mark.
IP Australia will follow the processes prescribed in the law to decide the outcome, which could be any of the following:
* The trade mark will be completely, or partially, removed from the Register (as above).

* The Registrar decides the trade mark should remain registered.

* In rare cases, the scope of the registered mark is limited in some way (e.g. to a specific territory)."
B1004,IP attorney or lawyer  ,"You receive clear, tailored guidance on the strength of the allegation and any defences.
* Early advice may prevent costly missteps such as accidental admissions or missed deadlines.

* They can handle stressful correspondence with the other side, letting you focus on the business.

* They can negotiate outcomes that preserve commercial relationships and limit public attention.

* They are bound by codes of conduct, professional standards and ethical obligations to act in your best interests, stay away from conflicts of interests and unethical conduct.

* They are able to recognise common issues which come up and refer you to other professionals if and when needed.","* Most IP lawyers and IP attorneys have different specialties and may be more effective in their particular field of expertise. For instance, an IP lawyer may be highly experienced in dealing with trade marks, but not so much in patents, or vice versa. Only lawyers can conduct proceedings in a court so, if you engage an IP attorney rather than an IP lawyer, they would need to refer you to an IP lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.

* Obtaining professional advice can be costly - see 'What might the costs be?' below.",,,* Anyone concerned about or accused of IP infringement.,,Many businesses use the services of IP lawyers or IP attorneys where they need advice or assistance.,The outcomes of seeing an IP lawyer or IP attorney depend heavily on your individual circumstances.
B1003,De-escalate,"* Can potentially de-escalate the situation and reduce the likelihood of expensive legal action or compensation claims - but often the other party will demand you do more than just stop using their IP. Other parties may still insist on other demands like you compensating them for your use of their IP up to the point where you stopped.

* Outcomes can be private where either the parties agree not to disclose the alleged infringement or they reach no formal agreement but neither party discloses it.

* Can show you're acting in good faith, which may help in future discussions, business dealings and negotiation - although this will depend on the nature of the alleged infringement.","* Ceasing use of contested IP may cause you to lose business revenue or incur business costs. This risk should be considered against the risk of further action against you if you do not cease use of contested IP.

* Ceasing use of contested IP may not prevent the IP owner seeking compensation for past use or otherwise taking further steps against you.

* The other party might see this action as conceding that you were infringing. Clear communication may sometimes help mitigate (but not eliminate) this risk, and you should note that admitting any fault or liability may well assist the other party's legal position against you.",,,Anyone who has been accused of using someone else's IP.,,Stopping the use of contested IP is a commonly used approach.,"* The IP owner accepts your response and nothing further happens.

* The IP owner may still not be satisfied with your actions and take further action.

* You might not be satisfied with permanently ceasing use of the contested IP, and could choose to further explore whether you are infringing and consider resuming your previous activities or taking other action."
