B1013,,Evaluate Threat Validity,"Consider whether the threat is unjustified
A key starting point can be to check the IP right registration status of the accuser (except for copyright, which in Australia does not have a formal registration system). You can search the Australian IP registers to check whether they have a current (not pending or expired) registered IP right. For design rights, the status must be listed as 'certified' (not simply registered) before they can enforce their design.
Review your own use of the contested IP and consider whether this might amount to infringement.
It can be very difficult to determine whether a threat is unjustified as you will usually need to determine whether the allegations of infringement are accurate. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you with considering whether a threat is unjustified and how you might best respond.
Gather evidence
Keep evidence of the threat, including:"
B1013,,Gather threat documentation,copies of the threat and any related emails or letters
B1013,,Consult an IP Lawyer,"evidence of how the threat has affected (or might affect) your business.
Consider getting help from an IP lawyer
Strongly consider the value of speaking to an IP lawyer. An IP lawyer can review the evidence, provide legal advice and represent you in court if the threat cannot be resolved in some other way.
Going to court without legal representation is not advisable and, in some cases, a court will require that you have legal representation."

C1003,,Describe Product Features,"Gather product or brand details: Describe your offering clearly to guide the search, particularly essential features that may differentiate your offering from the competitors.

D1010,,Assess Infringement and Identify Infringer,"Whether the other party's conduct amounts to infringement, having regard towhat infringement looks like, to avoid making unjustified threats. For registered IP, it's worth considering the 'scope of protection' of your registered claim. For trade marks, this includes the goods or services attached to your registration, and whether the other party is offering similar goods and services. For patents, it includes whether the product or process contains all the essential features of a claim in a granted patent.

D1028,,Prioritize Issues Over Personalities,"Focus on the issues at hand, not the personalities of the other parties involved."

D1028,,Document and Validate Agreement,"Be clear on the terms of agreement you reached with the other party, writing down the agreement in detail at the end of the conversation and making sure you enter into a legally binding agreement that reflects the negotiated outcome. An IP lawyer can assist you with negotiations or recording the outcomes in a legally binding agreement.
It can be difficult to determine whether negotiations are a suitable option. An IP professional can help you make this assessment and advise what steps would work best in your situation."

Respond to an unjustified threat | IP Australia First Response
Here are some things you might wish to check and consider before talking to the other party you should consider engaging an IP lawyer or IP attorney to work through these issues with you:"
Dxxxx,,Verify IP Status and Registrations,"The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where suspected infringement occurred. This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the alleged infringer has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices."
Dxxxx,,Evaluate Infringement and Scope of Protection,"Whether the other party's conduct amounts to infringement, having regard towhat infringement looks like, to avoid making unjustified threats. For registered IP, it's worth considering the 'scope of protection' of your registered claim. For trade marks, this includes the goods or services attached to your registration, and whether the other party is offering similar goods and services. For patents, it includes whether the product or process contains all the essential features of a claim in a granted patent. For designs, the scope of protection would require consideration of not only the visual appearance of the product but the tangible physical product (e.g. a chair, a bottle, etc.) that the design is applied to. Please note:a design right can only be enforced if the right is also certified. For more information please seeRequest certification for your registered design | IP Australia First Response"
