This is especially the case if you have a difficult relationship with the other parties involved or find it challenging to communicate with the other parties. For this reason, representatives such as lawyers are commonly used.\n\nIn some cases, having a neutral third party such as a mediator may help you overcome these challenges and facilitate an outcome, as opposed to direct negotiation (see – [Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/mediation))."

            "text": "Commercial negotiations can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the parties’ desires and specific circumstances. Some popular forms of commercial arrangements involving IP include:\n\n**Licensing**\n\nYou can agree to a licensing agreement. Licensing involves the owner of the IP or someone else with a right to licence the IP (the licensor) giving someone else (the licensee) permission to use – but not own – their IP usually in exchange for payment. For detailed information on types of licences and licence conditions, see [How To Licence My IP | IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip/how-to-commercialise-my-ip/how-to-licence-my-ip#:~:text=Licensing%20involves%20the%20owner%20of,IP%20in%20exchange%20for%20payment.).\n\n**Assignment (selling or transferring your IP)**\n\nYou may decide to sell your IP as part of your negotiation with the other party. This involves transferring the ownership of the IP to another entity (the assignee) through a process called ‘assignment’ so that you no longer have the rights to use the IP.\n\nOnce assignment is completed, you won’t have any control over the IP asset you have sold unless you have agreed that the assignee licence some rights back to you. The assignee will bear the risk of commercial development of the IP and be responsible for all costs, including renewal fees paid to IP Australia.\n\nOnce the title of a registered IP right has been assigned through a contractual agreement, the transfer of the ownership can be recorded on the IP Australia register through IP Australia’s[Online Services portal](https://portal.ipaustralia.gov.au/login?_gl=1%2an6kr9w%2a_ga%2aMTUwOTM4MDc5LjE3MzM3ODMxNTI.%2a_ga_GMT4KC15KS%2aMTczOTIyMTY0Ny41NS4xLjE3MzkyMjU5MTEuMC4wLjA.).\n\n**Franchising (trade marks)**\n\nIn a franchise agreement, you can give one or more parties (the franchisees) the right to use your trade mark or trade name, your business systems and processes, and so on.\n\nThe licensed rights are typically used by the franchisees to provide goods or services to agreed specifications. In return, they pay royalties and fees. Franchisees often contribute to marketing costs for the brand as well. Franchising is a highly regulated area of law and you should consult with a franchising expert such as a franchising lawyer before agreeing to a franchising agreement.\n\n**Letter of consent or co-existence agreement (trade marks)**\n\nTrade mark owners can negotiate to have their trade marks co-exist in the market. This can allow both parties to use potentially conflicting rights in ways that both agree to (such as in certain geographical areas).\n\nTrade mark co-existence agreements may take the form a formal contract stipulating rights and obligations of both parties, or a letter of consent where a party gives the other party (often in the form of[a letter](https://manuals.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademark/annex-a1---an-example-of-a-letter-of-consent) ) consent to the registration of their right with IP Australia."
