Making sure your customers understand what sets your product apart - and how to identify a fake - can reduce that risk.\nFor many types of IP rights, customer education supports both your marketing and IP strategy. It can help stop counterfeit or inferior copies from gaining traction and may make enforcement easier if you can show that your customers rely on specific brand cues.\nCustomer education can include:\n* Sharing the story and authenticity of your brand through advertising\n\n* Highlighting proprietary features of your product or service\n\n* Explaining where your genuine products are from, like official retailers or country of origin\n\n* Adding or promoting product validation tools-such as QR codes, security tags, or post-sale verification\n\n* Informing customers that your product is protected (for example, stating 'patented', listing a trade mark registration number, using the ® symbol to indicate atrade markhas been registered, or using a © symbol to indicatecopyrightmaterial (although the symbol is not required in order for the material to be protected by copyright)\n\n* Equipping sales teams to explain the value and unique features of your genuine product.",
