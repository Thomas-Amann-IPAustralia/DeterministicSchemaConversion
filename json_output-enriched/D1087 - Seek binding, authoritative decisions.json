This means there is limited legal precedent for judges and lawyers to draw on. This makes it harder to build a strong case, increases potential costs, and adds uncertainty to how a judge might rule.",

It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.\n\nConsider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim\n\n \n\nGoing to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.\n\nConsider the impact of publicity\n\n \n\nCourt proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.\n\nGather all your documents\n\n \n\nBefore seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review."

This can have implications for any costs you may incur.\n\n* If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful, time-consuming, and distract from the operation of your business.\n\n* Court proceedings are usually public unless they are covered by a confidentiality order, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.\n\n* You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential.\n\n* Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation - particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious.\n\n* It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see 'How much time might be involved?' below).\n\n* If you intend to commence proceedings against a party that you have a pre-existing contractual agreement with, it may be important to consider whether the agreement covers ways to deal with IP disputes. For example, some agreements may require a party try forms of alternative dispute resolution before they are able to commence proceedings"

The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start.\n* The limitation period for a designs infringement action is six years from the date on which the act of infringement took place. The infringement act must also have taken place in the period of registration.\n\n* If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.\nDue to these complexities, it may be helpful to speak to an IP lawyer about time limits."
