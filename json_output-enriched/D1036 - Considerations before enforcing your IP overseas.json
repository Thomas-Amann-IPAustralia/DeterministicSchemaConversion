      "description": "Different countries have different IP laws. Australian IP registration does not usually protect against overseas infringement. If your IP is being infringed overseas you might need to consider different enforcement methods specific to those jurisdictions. Enforcing your IP overseas can be complicated, but there are still a wide range of options available.\nFor Australian copyright material, a key factor in determining whether it is protected overseas is whether the overseas territory is a party to one of the relevant copyright conventions to which Australia is also a party. Most countries grant copyright protection to Australian material under international treaties. Further information about the international copyright treaties and conventions that Australia is party to is available on the Attorney-General's Department website: \n\nCopyright basics | Attorney-General's Department\n\n. Australia has also entered into a number of free trade agreements (FTAs) with individual countries and groups of countries. Many of these FTAs include agreed rules on copyright.\nThis page provides an overview of considerations when facing overseas infringement.\nActions you can consider against an overseas infringer will depend on the jurisdiction and the type of IP you own, but usually include:\n* Informal enforcementoptions such as sending letters, negotiations or online takedown notices. However, it might be more difficult to engage with international actors.\n\n* Strategic optionssuch as securing international rights for your intellectual property, partnering with local businesses, or other commercially-driven approaches.\n\n* Alternative dispute resolution(ADR) options are also available. These can be organised directly with the suspected infringer, through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), or through services offered by the relevant IP offices.\n\n* Civil, administrative or criminal legalenforcement options/schemes such as taking court action overseas. These will depend on the country/market involved.\n\n* your entitlement to IP in those markets\n\n* your existing market presence/potential for future expansion.\nWithout careful attention to the local operating environment, you may risk undermining your IP right.\nA local legal representative can help you understand these risks and how to mitigate them.",
