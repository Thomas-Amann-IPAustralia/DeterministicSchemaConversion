      "description": "Sometimes being accused of infringing someone else's intellectual property (IP) makes you aware of the other party's use of the contested IP for the first time. Looking into their allegations might lead you to suspect that it is actually you that has a stronger claim, and that it is your IP - not theirs - that is at risk of being infringed.\nIt is quite common for both parties involved in an IP dispute to believe that their IP has been copied or misappropriated by the other side. Some common situations include:\n* The owner of a registered trade mark being accused of copying someone's unregistered trade mark or branding.\n\n* Both parties believing that they are the rightful owner of contested IP. For instance, parties may have developed IP together but may have differing views as to who can own and use this IP, leading them to accuse each other of infringing the disputed IP.\nIf you think that someone accusing you of infringement is actually infringing \n\nyour\n\nIP, you can consider whether to take enforcement action against them.\nThere are a wide variety of enforcement actions with varying levels of formality, costs, benefits and risks, ranging from commercial, private pathways such as negotiation to something more formal, like court proceedings. Find out more about how to enforce your IP rights and compare different enforcement pathways by following the '\n\nI believe my IP has been infringed'\n\n \n\noption\n\n.\nBefore taking any of these actions, it can be a good idea to consider whether the other party's actions amount to infringement - see our information on \n\nwhat infringement can look like\n\n. A legal professional can help you make this assessment and give advice on your next steps.",
