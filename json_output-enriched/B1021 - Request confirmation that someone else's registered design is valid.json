      "description": "Third-party examination lets any person request IP Australia to conduct a formal examination of a registered Australian design. The examiner assesses newness, distinctiveness and compliance with formal requirements at the design's filing date.\nRequests may be lodged through IP Australia's Online Services or by post using the approved form, providing the design registration number, owner details and payment of the examination fee. A third party examination can be requested at any time, by any person who has an interest in the validity of design right. This makes it a versatile tool to:\n* respond to allegations that you have infringed against a registered design, or\n\n* to question the validity of a competitors registered design pre-emptively.\nOnce filed, IP Australia notifies the owner of the design right and provide information about possible options.\nThe design is examined by a designs examiner If the design does not meet the requirements, the registration may be revoked or reduced in scope; if it passes, the design becomes certified and fully enforceable in court proceedings.\nWhen submitting a request for third party examination, you can include documentation to support your argument. Documentation can include business documents\n\n, circumstances, general knowledge and evidence to support your argument.\nExamination can be requested any time after registration and before the design expires at the end of its maximum 10-year term (initial five years plus one 5-year renewal).\nFormal action to protect design rights - like sending a letter of demand (or cease-and-desist letter) - can only be initiated after a design right is certified. A threat to start infringement or similar proceedings against another person in respect of a design will be an unjustified threat if the design has not been certified. A person who receives such a threat can start legal action against the person making the threat: see\n\nRespond to an unjustified threat | IP Australia First Response\n\n.",
