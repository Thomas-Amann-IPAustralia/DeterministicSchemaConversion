This is especially the case if you have a difficult relationship with the other party involved or find it challenging to communicate with them. In these cases, representatives such as lawyers are commonly sought to provide legal advice and assistance.\nParties can propose and negotiate commercial outcomes in different ways, including communicating directly in person or through correspondence, or instructing their legal representatives to do so on their behalf.",
