## What is it?

A **Qualified Person (QP)** is a plant-science expert accredited by IP Australia to design, oversee and certify the growing trials used to prove a new variety meets the distinct, uniform and stable (DUS) criteria.  

Every Plant Breeder’s Right (PBR) application must name an accredited QP for the plant group in question. You must engage a QP even if you do not need to do an Australian growing trial.Finding the right QP can be essential for running a successful growing trial. Potential plant breeders should consider early if there is a relevant QP from the [Qualified Persons Directory](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/role-of-a-qualified-person/qualified-persons-directory#qpds_e=0)  or consider if the best option for them is to become a QP themselves.  

QP accreditation lasts three years and is tied to specific plant species or groups. QPs may work in consultant or non-consultant status to support breeders and liaise with IP Australia examiners. QPs support breeders and liaise with IP Australia examiners and can be registered to work as consultant QP’s for multiple applicants. They can also be non-consultant QP’s, overseeing growing trials for their own (or employer’s) plant varieties. 

If you have the necessary experience, you can **become** a QP by completing online training, submitting evidence of expertise and paying an accreditation fee. Processing times vary by application volume. Plant breeders have the option of becoming a QP to oversee their own PBR application.  

For breeders, engaging a QP usually involves searching the public  [Qualified Persons Directory](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/role-of-a-qualified-person/qualified-persons-directory#qpds_e=0)  and agreeing to the terms of a contract of work directly with an expert. 

## What are the benefits?

* Engaging a QP is a requirement to registering a PBR.
* Relevant expert oversight helps set up robust trials and increases chances of a PBR being accepted.
* Accredited status lends credibility when negotiating with investors or partners.
* Choosing the right QP can shorten overall application time by getting the trial right the first time. **Please note:** You must engage a QP even if you do not need to do an Australian growing trial.
* Outsourcing this work allows plant breeders to focus on commercial plans rather than technical paperwork.

## What are the risks?

* Due to the limited availability of QPs in some plant groups, not engaging a QP early in the process may result in scheduling delays.
* To become a QP yourself adds time and cost to the PBR application.

## What are the possible outcomes?

* For breeders:
  + Engaging a QP is a requirement to registering a PBR.
  + Finding a QP who specialised in your area can help your PBR application proceeds smoothly with certified trial data.
* To become a QP:
  + Accreditation is granted and the new QP is added to the public register.
  + Accreditation application is refused, requiring further evidence or experience.
  + Accreditation lapses if renewal paperwork or fees are not lodged on time.

## What might the costs be?

Applying to become a QP attracts an accreditation fee (currently $350, renewable every three years). 

For plant breeders, QP professional fees vary according to crop type, location and trial complexity - many experts charge a day rate or project fee. Engaging a QP early in the process can help you understand the additional costs outside of IP Australia fees.  

Other potential costs include travel to trial sites, sample analysis and any repeat trials if data is insufficient. 

## How much time might be involved?

QP accreditation assessments usually take a few weeks once all documentation is lodged, though this can vary. 

For breeders, the QP’s involvement spans the life of the growing trial - typically one to two growing seasons depending on plant type and environment - plus time to finalise the technical description. 

To become a QP, the accreditation training can take up to several months to complete and must be renewed every three years.  

## How much is this used?

There are a small number of accredited consultant QPs in Australia. To find a detailed list please visit the [Qualified Persons Directory](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/role-of-a-qualified-person/qualified-persons-directory#qpds_e=0) .
