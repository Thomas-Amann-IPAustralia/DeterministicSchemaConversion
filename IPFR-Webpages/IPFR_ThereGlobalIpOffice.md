## What is it?

Many people assume there is one IP office that grants rights everywhere in the world. In reality, each country has its own intellectual property (IP) office. For instance, IP Australia examines and registers patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeder’s rights (PBRs) for protection inside Australia.

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) helps countries work together on IP and provides systems to simplify applying for rights overseas. However, it is not a global IP office that grants or enforces rights.

WIPO’s core role is to administer international treaties, maintain global IP databases and provide systems that streamline applications across borders. It helps countries adopt consistent rules and offers tools businesses can use when expanding overseas. Key examples include:

**The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).**This allows you to file one application to seek patent protection in 158 Contracting States.**The Madrid System.**This provides a single-application path for registering trade marks in over 130 territories.**The Hague System.**This is an international route for protecting industrial designs in multiple countries.**The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center**. These services may resolve cross-border IP disputes without going to court.

Because WIPO focuses on coordination and policy development, national IP offices keep control of day-to-day tasks such as filing applications, examining rights, registration and renewal.

When your business grows beyond Australia, you may use WIPO’s ‘single-application’ process to streamline filing. However, the national IP office in each country still decides whether to grant protection in its jurisdiction under its own laws.

In short, WIPO is a hub for international treaty development and shared services, while national offices like IP Australia remain the home base for securing IP rights within their territories.
