### What is it?

Arbitration is a type of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in which a dispute is submitted, by agreement of the parties, to one or more arbitrators who make a binding decision on the dispute (known as an ‘arbitral award’). The arbitrator is often someone with a high level of expertise in the specific field of law relevant to the industry or subject matter of the dispute.  

Arbitration can be somewhat similar to a court or tribunal hearing, but often are a shorter and more flexible version: 

* Parties are typically expected to produce evidence and submissions before the arbitrator to make a decision.
* Usually, the parties to the dispute must agree before the process that the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and enforceable.
* Arbitration is generally seen as an efficient, impartial, and enforceable process to resolve both domestic and international commercial disputes, including IP matters.

Arbitration may be voluntary, required under a court order, or as part of a contract – arbitration clauses are often added to contracts, stipulating that the parties resolve future disputes using this method.  

Arbitration requires agreement from both parties, which can be challenging to obtain after a dispute arises, especially in cases involving no prior contractual relationship. For this reason, where there are contractual negotiations, it is often advantageous for parties to consider including an arbitration clause in their initial contract.

### What are the benefits?

* The potential outcome(s) of arbitration are highly enforceable, as Australia is a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (‘the New York Convention’). Australia has implemented the New York Convention through *International Arbitration Act 1974* (Cth) and through uniform State and Territory statutes governing domestic arbitration.
* Arbitration can be conducted across different jurisdictions and arbitral awards are often comparatively easier to enforce in foreign jurisdictions under the New York Convention, which is an advantage over court proceedings for cross-border disputes.
* Parties can choose their arbitrator/s and have some flexibility and control over shaping the process (for example, through scheduling, rules of evidence and procedures).
* Parties can narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides.
* Parties can also choose arbitrators with sector-specific expertise in relation to the subject matter of the IP dispute, which may be preferable when the dispute concerns highly technical issues.
* The details and outcome of arbitration can be kept confidential, subject to the parties’ agreement, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.
* Arbitration may offer a faster and more cost-effective alternative to court proceedings.

### What are the risks?

* Arbitral awards are generally final with limited grounds for appeal, which can be a risk if the decision is unfavourable.
* In some cases, arbitration can become as expensive as court proceedings, particularly if complex IP issues require specialised arbitrators.
* The outcome of arbitration can be unpredictable as arbitration does not necessarily follow the rules of procedure and evidence applicable in court proceedings.
* Arbitral awards do not automatically set a *legal precedent*; the ruling of the arbitrator/s will apply to the parties to the dispute only.

### What are the possible outcomes?

There are a wide range of possible outcomes, including but not limited to: 

* If parties to a dispute agree to resolve their dispute via arbitration, the arbitrator will make a ruling through an arbitral award at the conclusion of the process.
* Parties might reach a negotiated settlement prior to the arbitrator making an award and withdraw from the process.
* In some rare cases, the arbitral award can be subject to further court proceedings due to factors such as lack of validity in the arbitration agreement or the dispute concerning non-arbitrable subject matter.

### What might the costs be?

The costs of arbitration will typically include: 

* Arbitrator’s fee
* Administrative fees (i.e. filing fee) payable to the arbitral institution
* (Optional) Legal fees for engaging an IP professional to act on your behalf.

A considerable portion in the costs of arbitration process is the arbitrator’s fee. The hourly rate of an arbitrator would differ significantly depending on the amount in dispute and which arbitration/arbitral institution the parties choose. Due to the high legal and subject-matter expertise required of an arbitrator, the cost of engaging them can be extremely expensive.   

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center provides that cases under the WIPO Expedited Arbitration Rules cost around [US$48,000 and cases under the WIPO Arbitration Rules cost some US$165,000](https://www.wipo.int/web/wipo-magazine/articles/what-does-it-cost-to-defend-your-ip-rights-38493)  (48% of such cases involving a three member tribunal and 52% a sole arbitrator). 

While legal representation is optional, very often parties to the dispute would choose to engage legal professionals to give advice and represent them. As such, the largest portion of arbitration-related costs is likely to be legal fees for engaging legal professionals. 

### How much time might be involved?

Length of arbitration process can vary drastically depending on the complexity of the subject matter and the procedural rules agreed by respective parties. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)’s Dispute Resolution 2023 Statistics show the average duration of arbitrations was [27 months](https://iccwbo.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/2023-Statistics_ICC_Dispute-Resolution_991.pdf). Some arbitration providers also provide expedited arbitration processes designed to resolve the dispute in a shortened timeframe. 

### Who can use this?

Anybody who is a party to a dispute.  

Who’s involved? 

* Parties to the disputes.
* Arbitrator(s), whose role is to hear both parties and make a ruling.
* (Optional) Legal representation for one or more of the participants.
* (Optional) Experts giving evidence for the arbitrator to consider.

### How much is this used?

IP Australia does not have oversight over arbitration but it is reported that there were 27 international arbitration cases involving Australian disputants in 2023, though not all of these relate to IP disputes.

### What do you need to proceed?

Before you engage in arbitration, you should think about whether arbitration is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and which arbitration types would suit your needs best. 

Some questions to consider before you take your dispute to arbitration:   

1. Is there an existing contractual relationship between the parties which requires them (such as through an arbitration clause) to take disputes to a specific arbitral institution?
2. If not, is the other party likely to agree to take the dispute to an arbitrator or an arbitral institution?
3. Does the dispute concern a highly technical matter which would benefit from having a decision-maker with a high level of expertise in the specific sector or technology?
4. Is the subject matter of the dispute considered arbitrable in relevant jurisdictions? Though most areas of IP are considered arbitrable in many jurisdictions, questions relating to validity or registrability of intellectual property are deemed as non-arbitrable in some jurisdictions.
5. Is there a clear benefit that can be achieved from having the matter heard under procedural and evidence rules different from those of court proceedings?
6. Is more than one arbitrator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a legal practitioner as co-arbitrators?
