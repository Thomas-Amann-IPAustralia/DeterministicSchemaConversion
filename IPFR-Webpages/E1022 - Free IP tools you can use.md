### What is it?

Free IP tools are no-cost online services that let you look up, track and learn about intellectual property (IP) rights. They cover everything from quick trade mark checks to deep patent searches and step-by-step help guides. 

Using these tools may boost your confidence before spending money on paid databases or engaging professional help. They can help you spot obvious conflicts, confirm renewal dates or see if someone is already using a similar brand. 

Most tools work through online forms. Users can enter keywords, images or classification codes and receive instant results drawn from official registers such as Australian trade mark, patent, design and plant breeder's rights databases, or global collections like the Global Brand Database. 

Many also include learning modules, alerts or visual maps so users can keep an eye on possible competitors. Some providers (e.g. PATENTSCOPE) offer free accounts for saving searches and setting up email notifications. 

These services focus on publicly available data. Results are often limited to the scope of their own databases (e.g. IP Australia registers will only have data relating to applications submitted to IP Australia), and can be hard to interpret. If you are worried about copying, it's important to remember that only a court can confirm that infringement has occurred. It's also important to make sure that your confidential details are never be entered into public search tools.
