### What is it?

If you are unhappy with how a lawyer or a patent or trade marks attorney has acted, you may be able to make a formal complaint to the body that regulates them. This process is meant to protect the public, keep professional standards high, and deal with serious misconduct. 

For lawyers, complaints are handled by the relevant regulator in each state and territory. They can look into both service issues (such as poor communication or delays) and conduct issues (such as dishonesty or serious breaches of professional rules). 

For registered patent and trade marks attorneys, complaints go to the **Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board** (TTIPAB). This Board makes sure attorneys follow their Code of Conduct, which requires them to act lawfully, in the best interests of clients and in the public interest. 

Before making a formal complaint, it is often worth trying to resolve the problem directly with the lawyer or attorney, or someone more senior in their firm. Many issues can be addressed through clearer communication or by following the firm’s own complaint process. 

To issue a complaint you will usually need to provide: 

* Your name and contact details.
* The name of the lawyer or attorney.
* A clear description of what happened and when.
* Copies of relevant documents, emails, or agreements.

There are often **time limits**. Many regulators will not investigate matters that happened more than three years ago, unless there are special circumstances or it is in the public interest. 

After you lodge a complaint, the regulator may: 

* Dismiss it if there is not enough evidence or it is outside their scope.
* Offer mediation to help both sides reach agreement.
* Investigate to decide if professional rules were broken.

**Please note:** Regulators usually cannot order a lawyer or attorney to pay you compensation. If you want compensation, you may need to look at other dispute resolution processes or court action.
