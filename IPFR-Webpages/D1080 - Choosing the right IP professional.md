## Hiring a professional

# Choosing the right IP professional

*This IP First Response website has been designed to help IP rights holders navigate IP infringement and enforcement by making it visible, accessible, and to provide information about the factors involved in pursuing different options. It does not provide legal, business or other professional advice, and none of the content should be regarded as recommending a specific course of action. We welcome any feedback via our* [*IP First Response feedback form*](https://ipaustralia.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6LKlgPWZqiheCiy)  *and by* [*emailing us*](mailto:IPFirstResponse@IPAustralia.gov.au?subject=Feedback%20on%20IP%20First%20Response)*.*

Navigating intellectual property (IP) can be confusing. Different professionals offer different expertise, and their services sometimes overlap. The notes below explain who does what, how they can help, and what to consider when choosing someone for your situation. Engaging the right professional to help secure your IP rights may help you get more value from your ideas and business opportunities. 

### What all IP professionals have in common

* IP professionals are typically engaged on a fee-for-service basis, either charged hourly or on an amount agreed upon per task.
* They provide expert advice and guidance, but the final decisions and responsibility for action remain with you.
* Some may specialise in a particular IP right, industry or area, such as mining, biotechnology, online enforcement, or international IP rights.
* Many have professional networks and may be able to refer you to other experts, including contacts in other countries.

### Legal professionals

If you are seeking advice on how to enforce or defend your IP rights, and what actions might be most appropriate for your situation, speak to a lawyer or other relevant legal professional. We use the term 'legal professional' to refer to professionals who aren't necessarily lawyers, such as IP attorneys. IP attorneys (registered patent or trade mark attorneys) are not necessarily lawyers, but they are qualified to provide information about protecting IP.

Many IP lawyers and IP attorneys have specialties relating to particular industries or situations, and may be more effective in their particular field of expertise. For instance, some IP lawyers may specialise and be highly experienced in dealing with trade marks, but less experienced with patents.

Both an IP lawyer or IP attorney can provide you with advice and act for you at different stages of IP protection and enforcement. Read below to consider which is most appropriate for your needs.

### Trade mark attorneys

**Who they are:** Specialists in trade marks who focus on obtaining and maintaining registered IP rights to protect brands (names, logos, slogans) and support business growth.

**Professional standards:** Attorneys must be registered with the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board. They are required to complete ongoing education, and are bound by strict professional and ethical standards.

**How they can help (for example):**

* Advise whether a brand is registrable and run clearance searches to identify conflicts.
* Prepare and lodge trade mark applications in Australia and some other countries; manage renewals and ownership changes.
* Help respond to objections and file oppositions with IP Australia in relation to trade mark applications.
* Advise on brand strategy and related IP options where appropriate.
* Monitor competitors and support steps to enforce rights.
* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.
* Assist with licensing.
* Advise on possible infringement risks relating to others' rights.

**What they don't do:**  A trade mark attorney cannot provide general legal advice and can't conduct proceedings in a court. If you engage an IP attorney, they would need to refer you to a lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.

**Where to find one:**  You can find a qualified IP attorney to assist you on the Trans-Tasman Attorneys Board website: [Find an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm?_gl=1*wp2lum*_ga*MTUwOTM4MDc5LjE3MzM3ODMxNTI.*_ga_GMT4KC15KS*MTczNjgxNTEyNS4yNS4xLjE3MzY4MTY5MDEuMC4wLjA.#als_iptags=Trade%20marks&als_e=0).

### Patent attorneys

**Who they are:** Specialists in patent law and practice with in-depth knowledge of one or more fields of science or technology, used to help protect inventions.

**Professional standards:** Attorneys must be registered with the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board. They are required to complete ongoing education, and are bound by strict professional and ethical standards.

**How they can help (for example but not limited to):**

* Assess whether an idea might be protectable by a patent and conduct prior-art searches.
* Draft and file patent applications in Australia, and advise on timing and jurisdictions aligned to business goals.
* Provide strategies to protect inventions and to monitor competitors' activity.
* Assist in patent office processes (e.g. examination, oppositions).
* Advise on other IP options (for example, designs, trade marks and protection of trade secrets).
* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.
* Monitor competitors and support steps to enforce rights.
* Assist with licensing and technology transfer.
* Conduct IP audits to identify protectable ideas and potential gaps.
* Advise on possible infringement risks relating to others' rights.
* Help you commercialise ideas in a way that supports business growth.

**What they don't do:**  A patent attorney cannot provide general legal advice and can't conduct proceedings in a court. If you engage an IP attorney, they would need to refer you to a lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.

**Where to find one:** You can find a qualified IP attorney to assist you at: [Find an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm?_gl=1*wp2lum*_ga*MTUwOTM4MDc5LjE3MzM3ODMxNTI.*_ga_GMT4KC15KS*MTczNjgxNTEyNS4yNS4xLjE3MzY4MTY5MDEuMC4wLjA.#als_iptags=Trade%20marks&als_e=0).

### IP lawyers (including solicitors and barristers)

**Who they are:** Lawyers who specialise in IP law, which for some is regarded a distinct area of legal practice involving a focus on IP rights matters. \
In Australia, "lawyer" is a broad term that includes both solicitors and barristers. Most individuals and businesses will engage a solicitor as their first point of legal contact.

* Solicitors provide legal advice, manage disputes, and prepare legal documents.
* Barristers are specialists in court advocacy, representing their clients in court.
* An "IP lawyer" typically refers to a solicitor who specialises in intellectual property law and may collaborate with a barrister for litigation.

**Qualifications:** All lawyers must hold a law degree, be admitted to legal practice in an Australian jurisdiction, and maintain a practising certificate. Solicitors and barristers are separately regulated and may also pursue specialist accreditation in IP law.

**What they can do (for example but not limited to):** 

* Advise you on different areas of IP law, often including infringement, licensing, ownership, commercialisation, and enforcement.
* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.
* Draft and negotiate legally binding agreements such as licences, assignments, confidentiality agreements (also referred to as non-disclosure agreements or NDAs), and terms of use.
* Issue or respond to cease and desist letters relating to potential IP infringement
* Represent you in dispute resolution processes such as negotiation, mediation, and appearances in lower courts.
* Manage the legal aspects of an IP dispute and manage complex or higher court proceedings.
* Help identify and mitigate legal risks associated with creating, using, or enforcing IP.

It's a good idea to ask for an indication of how much the entire process may cost during your first meeting. IP lawyers have a professional obligation to provide you with an upfront estimate of their fees and costs.

**What they don't do:** Lawyers generally do not prepare technical IP specifications unless they are also registered as patent attorneys. Generally speaking, if your legal matter goes to court, solicitors will work with a barrister to represent you in court. 

By engaging an IP professional, they will aim to provide their services to achieve your intended outcome - but they are obliged to follow the instructions you provide them. While they can advise you on certain courses of action, you have the ultimate decision and responsibility.
