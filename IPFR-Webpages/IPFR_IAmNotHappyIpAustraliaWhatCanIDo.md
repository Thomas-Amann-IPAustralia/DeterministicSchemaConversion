*This IP First Response website has been designed to help IP rights holders navigate IP infringement and enforcement by making it visible, accessible, and to provide information about the factors involved in pursuing different options. It does not provide legal, business or other professional advice, and none of the content should be regarded as recommending a specific course of action. We welcome any feedback via our **IP First Response feedback form* * and by **emailing us**.*

## What is it?

If you are not happy with the service you received from IP Australia, there are ways you can raise your concerns. A complaint allows you to explain what went wrong and what outcome you would like.

Complaints are handled separately from IP decisions. Making a complaint does not replace or pause any formal review or appeal deadlines. If you want to challenge a formal decision (for example, an objection being raised for a trade mark or patent), you need to use the separate review and appeal processes available. **For more information about this process please see here: **[ What can I do if I disagree with IP Australia’s examination decision? | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/what-can-i-do-if-i-disagree-ip-australias-examination-decision).

When making a complaint, it helps if you include:

- your name and contact details
- details of the issue, including any reference numbers
- what outcome you are hoping for (such as an explanation, correction, or apology)
- any evidence or documents that support your complaint.

IP Australia staff are required to follow the Australian Public Service (APS) Code of Conduct. This means they must behave honestly, act with care and diligence, and treat everyone with respect and courtesy. If you feel this did not happen, you may raise that in your complaint.

You can start by contacting IP Australia directly through their __online feedback form__ or by using the [ contact channels ](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/contact-us) on their website. If you are not satisfied with the response, you may take your complaint to
