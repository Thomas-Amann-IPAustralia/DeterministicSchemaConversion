*This IP First Response website has been designed to help IP rights holders navigate IP infringement and enforcement by making it visible, accessible, and to provide information about the factors involved in pursuing different options. It does not provide legal, business or other professional advice, and none of the content should be regarded as recommending a specific course of action. We welcome any feedback via our **IP First Response feedback form* * and by **emailing us**.*

## This right is currently not covered by the navigation tool

Information relevant to the enforcement of other types of IP has not been included as part of the platform’s pilot. However, IP First Response contains general information which may be useful for the enforcement of all intellectual property. Consider exploring the enforcement options and whether they may still contain information that’s useful for your situation.

This tool is currently in early-stage development and testing, aimed at determining its usefulness to rights holders like you. We invite you to provide feedback about this navigator tool, IP First Response, and your experience enforcing your IP through our [ IP First Response feedback form ](https://ipaustralia.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6LKlgPWZqiheCiy) and/or via email at
