However, a lot of infringing and counterfeiting activities occur in this space as well, which can undermine legitimate brands and damage their reputation.

Some platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, invite you to add your trade marks and other kinds of IP rights to a brand registry.

A time and cost-effective way to manage this process is often to engage IP professionals such as IP monitoring services. These IP professionals can use their experience and knowledge to identify and remove counterfeit goods across multiple online platforms.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Beyond online marketplaces, many other digital platforms available to Australian users (including social media platforms to which users can upload content) also offer mechanisms that copyright owners can use to address or prevent infringement. These often include complaint forms and notice and takedown processes that copyright owners can use if they believe their rights have been infringed. They may also include bespoke tools copyright owners can choose use to proactively manage and enforce their rights on those platforms. For example,&nbsp; automated content recognition/identification or screening tools (like YouTube Content ID or Meta Rights Manager) allow copyright owners to upload their content and find matches to content uploaded on platforms by third parties. Where matches are found, copyright owners may be able to seek to pre-emptively block or otherwise monetise the content (for example, through share of advertising revenue in some cases).</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the benefits?</span></h2><ul><li><span>Cost-effective.</span></li><li><span>Often quick to action and obtain outcome.</span></li><li><span>Simple to prepare and initiate compared to other enforcement options.</span></li><li><span>Outcome-focused, as it targets infringing products/content directly and prevents customers making purchases/accessing the infringing content.</span></li><li><span>Some platforms are not limited by the country the infringer is located in, due to these platforms having an international reach – while others only action takedown requests within jurisdictions in which the rights apply.</span></li><li><span>You may not need to identify or track down the infringer yourself.</span></li><li><span>Being able to reduce infringement and prevent sales being diverted by addressing infringement on a major sales channel.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the risks?</span></h2><ul><li><span>Due to the one-off nature of this process there is a risk that the counterfeiters/infringers can return in the future.
