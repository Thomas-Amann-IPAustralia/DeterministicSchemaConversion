If you wish to respond to the opposition and establish that there is a case for removal based on non-use, this will lengthen the removal process and take up further cost, time and efforts.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">A party who is dissatisfied with IP Australia’s decision can also appeal it to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court of Australia, which could be highly time-consuming and costly.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Exposure resulting from notification and publication</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">The owner and their representative of the trade mark which is subject to a removal procedure will be notified of your application to remove the trade mark. This notification happens within one month of filing the application. A copy of the application will be forwarded with the notification, which will include your details and the details of your filing.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">IP Australia also must give notice of the application for removal by publishing it on the Australian Trade Marks Search (‘the Register’). This means that other parties would be aware of your identity and also your attempt to remove the trade mark from the Register. This may trigger the other party to oppose your application or initiate other forms of action (i.e. administrative hearings, court proceedings, etc.) against you and/or your business.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the possible outcomes?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">If the application for removal is advertised and no one opposes it within the required time:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">The trade mark will be completely removed from the Register, or</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The trade mark will partially be removed from the Register, namely in relation to the goods and services as specified in your application for removal.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-AU">If the other party opposes your request to remove their trade mark within the two-month opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">The person opposing the removal of the trade mark is required to establish, by filing evidence, that they have used the trade mark for the goods and services which are the subject of the removal application or that there are other circumstances justifying the non-use of the mark.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">IP Australia will follow the processes prescribed in the law to decide the outcome, which could be any of the following:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">The trade mark will be completely, or partially, removed from the Register (as above).</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The Registrar decides the trade mark should remain registered.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">In rare cases, the scope of the registered mark is limited in some way (e.g. to a specific territory).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What might the costs be?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">The applicant must pay a fee of $350 for filing the removal application. The process can, however, incur further costs when your application is opposed — For instance, IP Australia may decide in favour of the opposition and require you to pay the other party's costs.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">If you are engaging a legal professional to act on your behalf, you will likely incur additional legal fees. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-AU">How much time might be involved?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">If unopposed, your application to remove a trade mark will be advertised shortly after filing, and then the mark will be removed following the two-month opposition period.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">If someone opposes your application to remove the trade mark within opposition period, you will be given one month to indicate that you will defend your application for removal from opposition.
