Proving you are in the right, legally, may not be the same as making a good business decision.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The other party to the legal action may make counterclaims or other legal claims against you.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">On top of paying your legal costs, you may be required to pay some (or all) of the legal costs of the other party or parties if you are wholly (or partially) unsuccessful.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The outcome you obtain may not be as advantageous as an offer of settlement previously made to you.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">If you or your staff are required to provide evidence in court, this can be very stressful and time-consuming and distract from the operation of your business</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Court proceedings are usually public, so this option may not be suitable if confidentiality is important.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">You may be required to disclose information in the proceedings to the other party or parties that you may prefer to keep confidential. </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Court proceedings may attract unwanted publicity and potentially damage your reputation – particularly if you are unsuccessful or if your case is seen as unduly litigious. </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">It can take a lot of time to prepare a legal claim and for proceedings to be finalised if the claim is not settled by the parties (see ‘How much time might be involved?’ below).</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">You may not be able to bring a legal claim if you have agreed in a contract that you will use, or that you will first try, an alternative form of dispute resolution.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the possible outcomes?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">here are a wide range of possible outcomes, and these will also depend on the type of court action you might take. Some possible outcomes are:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">You might reach a negotiated settlement with the other party. </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The other party might not respond or participate in the court proceedings, in which case the court might decide in your favour.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The other party’s trade mark registration might be cancelled, removed or amended.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The court might decide against you, in which case your trade mark registration could be cancelled, removed or amended and you may need to pay some or all of the other party’s legal costs. </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">You could be awarded damages or compensation.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your IP rights – including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter (see </span><a href="https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/Interim_Injunction" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-AU"><u>Seek an urgent injunction</u></span></a><span lang="EN-AU">). </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims for </span><em><span lang="EN-AU">passing off</span></em><span lang="EN-AU"> or under the Australian Consumer Law).&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-AU">In most cases, the outcome can be appealed to a higher court. &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>What might the costs be?</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">Infringement and other court proceedings are generally very expensive as legal representation is usually involved and they can take a long time to resolve. Companies in particular are generally required by court rules to be represented by legal practitioners.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Legal fees and the cost of expert witnesses usually make up most of the cost.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">It is common for the costs of trade mark-related litigation in the Federal Court of Australia to exceed $100,000.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>How much time might be involved?</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, which court hears your claim, and the backlog of matters before that court.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Trade mark claims are typically heard by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed </span><em><span lang="EN-AU">intellectual property</span></em><span lang="EN-AU"> as the cause of action, were as follows:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">95 cases (45%) under 12 months</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">43 cases (21%) 12-24 months</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">71 cases (34%) over 24 months.<sup>1</sup></span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>The timeframe is typically shorter if the matter is resolved through negotiations or a court-ordered mediation process.</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing. &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Limitations on how long you can take to file an action&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">The limitation period for a trade mark infringement action in most Australian states is six years from the date on which the first act of infringement took place, with the exception of Northern Territory where the limitation period is three years. </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-AU">Due to these complexities, it may be helpful to speak to an IP lawyer about time limits.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>How much is this used?</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">Trade mark proceedings are not particularly common in Australia because they can be expensive and time consuming for the parties involved. However, they are more common than some other types of intellectual property disputes like patent proceedings.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">In the 2023–24 financial year, there were 77 trade mark filings in the Federal Court of Australia<sup>2</sup></span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Some trade mark proceedings are also started in State/Territory courts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-AU"></span><span lang="EN-AU">Who can use this?</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">For infringement actions, the owner of the registered trade mark usually starts the infringement action. However, an exclusive licensee or authorised user may also hold the right to start an action.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Other court actions can generally be taken by any aggrieved party with a relevant interest in the matter.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-AU">Who’s involved?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">Parties to the dispute </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Lawyers</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Witnesses</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">A judge</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What you need to proceed?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">Here are some things you might consider before you proceed with legal action in a trade mark matter.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Finding an IP lawyer for advice and representation</strong></span><br><span lang="EN-AU">Court proceedings can be an expensive, time-consuming, stressful, complicated process that can have serious impacts on you and your business. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim</strong></span><br><span lang="EN-AU">Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option.
