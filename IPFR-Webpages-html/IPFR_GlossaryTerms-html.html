                  <h2><strong>Glossary</strong></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Alleged infringement / Suspected infringement</strong></span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span lang="EN-AU">Infringement is the unauthorised use of intellectual property.

This is different from ownership but still gives certain rights.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Cease and desist letter</strong> (or letter of demand)</span><span>- </span><span lang="EN-AU">A letter sent to someone asking them to stop doing something that may be a suspected infringement of your IP rights.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-AU">Letters of Demand and Cease and Desist letters are not the same, though they usually play a similar role in legal disputes.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Commercialisation</strong></span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span lang="EN-AU">Turning your idea or invention into a product or service that earns income.

Copyright does not cover ideas alone though; it applies only to expressions of ideas.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Designs</strong></span><span>&nbsp;or Design Rights - </span><span lang="EN-AU">A type of IP right that protects the visual appearance of a product. In Australia, this means a registered design. It must be new and distinctive.

Often used to describe suspected infringement.

It can still be challenged before it’s registered.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Being challenged –&nbsp; </strong>Someone is opposing the trade mark after it was accepted. A decision will be made before it can be registered.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Expired – </strong>The trade mark registration has ended, usually because it wasn’t renewed on time.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Removed – </strong>The trade mark has been taken off the register, often because it wasn’t used or renewal fees weren’t paid.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang="EN-AU">Patent status</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Granted - </strong>A patent has passed all checks and has been officially approved by IP Australia.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Filed - </strong>A patent application has been submitted but hasn’t been looked at by IP Australia yet.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Under examination - </strong>The patent application is being checked by IP Australia to see if it meets the legal requirements.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Accepted - </strong>The patent application has passed examination and has been published.
