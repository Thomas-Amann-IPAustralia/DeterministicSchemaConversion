		<div class="option-overview-body">      <h2><span lang="EN-AU">What is infringement?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU"></span><span lang="EN-AU">Intellectual property infringement occurs when someone uses, reproduces, or exploits another person’s or business’s creative work, invention, brand name, or design without permission. This concept applies across all types of intellectual property (IP) rights protected under Australian law, including patents, trade marks, designs, copyright, and plant breeders’ rights.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Understanding the basics of IP infringement is essential for anyone who creates, innovates, or operates a business in Australia. This article provides a general introduction to the concept of infringement and what it means for both IP owners and those who may use others’ IP.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-GB">What does infringement m</span><span lang="EN-AU">ean</span><span lang="EN-GB">?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">At its simplest, infringement occurs when someone uses another’s protected creative work or invention without that person’s permission or consent. Australian law gives creators and inventors legal protection and rights over their work. Australian IP law protects various types of intellectual creations. These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders’ rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">When someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Think of it as using someone else’s property without asking. Just as you would not use someone’s car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><a class="ct-content-link ct-theme-light" href="https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/trade-mark-infringement">Trade mark infringement</a></li><li><a class="ct-content-link ct-theme-light" href="https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/patent-infringement">Patent infringement</a></li><li><a class="ct-content-link ct-theme-light" href="https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/design-infringement">Design infringement</a></li><li><a class="ct-content-link ct-theme-light" href="https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/plant-breeders-right-pbr-infringement">Plant Breeder's Rights (PBR) infringement</a></li><li><a class="ct-content-link ct-theme-light" href="https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/copyright-infringement">Copyright infringement</a></li><li><a class="ct-content-link ct-theme-light" href="https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/unregistered-trade-marks">Unregistered trade marks&nbsp;</a></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">Why IP infringement matters</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">IP infringement matters for several reasons:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>For IP owners</strong>: </span><span lang="EN-GB">Someone using your IP without permission can damage your business, cost you money, and weaken the value of what you have created.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>For businesses and creators</strong>: Using someone else’s protected IP without permission can lead to legal disputes, financial penalties, and damage to your reputation.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>For everyone</strong>: Australia’s IP system tries to balance rewarding creators with allowing new ideas to flourish. Respecting IP rights helps maintain this balance.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol><h2><span lang="EN-AU">Key elements of IP infringement</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-GB">While different types of IP have their own specific rules, some common elements help determine if infringement </span><span lang="EN-AU">might be occurring</span><span lang="EN-GB">:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>1. There must be protected intellectual property</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">For infringement to occur, the creative work or invention must first be protected under the law. This means answering the question, ‘What exactly is protected?’ Different rules apply to different types of IP and protect only specific aspects of creation or innovation.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Some types of IP, like patents, trade marks, and designs, must be officially registered with IP Australia to be protected. On the other hand, IP rights, such as copyright, are automatically protected when certain conditions are met.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Importantly, IP rights must be in place that have not expired. The various IP rights last for different periods:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">Patents generally last up to 20 years</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Trade marks can last forever if renewed</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Designs last a maximum of 10 years</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Copyright lasts generally 70 years after the creator dies</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Plant breeders’ rights last up to 20 or 25 years, depending on the plant variety.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>2. Someone used it without permission</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">The person or business must use the protected IP without proper permission (commonly called the alleged infringer). </span><span lang="EN-GB">Without some form of "yes, you can use this," using protected IP might be considered infringement.</span><span lang="EN-AU"> Permission might be granted through:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">Written agreement allowing its use (called a licence)</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Written agreement to transfer ownership (called an assignment)</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Informal permission (verbal agreement or consent).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>3. What they are using is too similar</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">When determining infringement, the material created or the activity of the alleged infringer is examined. The alleged infringing material or activity must be sufficiently similar to the protected IP to create a problem. How this is judged under the law depends on the type of IP involved. Different tests are applied to determine what constitutes a problematic level of similarity.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>For patents</strong>: Are they using what a granted patent specifically describes and claims?</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>For trade marks</strong>: Are they using a trade mark that is too similar and likely to confuse customers, and is it being used on similar goods or services?</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>For designs</strong>: Does the product look too much like the protected design?</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>For copyright</strong>: Have they copied a substantial part of the original work?</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>For plant breeders’ rights</strong>: Have they propagated or copied the protected plant variety?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>4. How it is being used matters</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">How the IP is used is an important factor in determining infringement though the requirements vary by the IP type:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Trade marks</strong>: To infringe a registered trade mark, someone needs to use something similar to the registered mark to brand or identify their products or services in the marketplace. Mentioning the brand name in conversation or for informational purposes, or in non-commercial contexts, is generally not infringement.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Designs</strong>: Infringement typically involves making, importing, selling, or using products that incorporate the protected design. While often commercial, infringement can occur in non-commercial contexts.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Patents</strong>: Infringement occurs when someone makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports the patented invention without permission.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Plant breeders’ rights</strong>: Infringement is primarily in commercial contexts, involving production, reproduction, conditioning for propagation, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, or stocking of the protected plant variety.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Copyright</strong>: Copyright infringement can occur in both commercial and non-commercial situations. Copying, distributing, performing, or displaying copyrighted works without permission can be infringement.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>5. When using someone’s IP might be allowed</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">Even if someone is using IP in a way that appears to infringe, there may be legal defences or exceptions that allow their use. Each type of IP right has its own defences. Here are some common defences:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Trade marks: </strong>Using your own name in business is a defence.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Patents</strong>: Using a patented invention for experimental use, like research and testing, is a defence.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Copyright: </strong>Using copyright material for research or study, criticism or review, parody or satire, or news reporting are defences.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Designs:</strong> Making parts needed to repair a complex product is a defence.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Plant breeders’ rights</strong>: Using a plant variety for the purpose of experimentation, further breeding, like cross breeding, or using the variety for private and non-commercial use.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">Example scenarios</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">Here are some general examples that illustrate potential IP infringement situations:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Example 1</strong>: A small business develops and uses a logo that closely resembles another cafe’s registered trade mark. Even without the intention to copy, this similarity could constitute infringement if it might confuse consumers about the source of the services.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Example 2</strong>: A manufacturer creates a product using a method that incorporates all the essential steps described in someone else’s granted patent. This is likely infringement, even if they were unaware of the patent.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>Example 3</strong>: A website copies an image from another website without asking for permission. This may constitute copyright infringement, even if the website provides a source for the image.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">Common misconceptions/myths about IP infringement</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-GB">There are several misunderstandings about IP infringement that many people believe:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>“If I change it by 10%, it’s not infringement”</strong>: Each IP right has different tests for when something is too similar. No fixed percentage change automatically avoids infringement.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>“I didn't know they owned it”</strong>: Not knowing about someone else’s IP rights usually is not a defence against infringement.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>“I’m not charging for it, so it’s not infringement”</strong>: Even if you are not making money from it, using someone’s IP without permission can still be infringement.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>“I’m giving credit to the creator”</strong>: Acknowledging the source of material does not necessarily avoid infringement.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>"It’s not registered, so I can use it "</strong>: Some IP rights, like copyright, do not require registration to be protected.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">Why it’s hard to figure out on your own</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">Determining whether infringement has occurred can be tricky and often needs legal expertise. Courts make the final decisions on infringement cases, and many involve complicated legal arguments. Things that make it hard to assess include:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">The complexity of IP laws</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Understanding precisely what is protected</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Judging whether something is too similar</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Knowing which exceptions or defences might apply</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Keeping up with changes in how courts interpret the laws.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
