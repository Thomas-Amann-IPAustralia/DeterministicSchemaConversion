Any consideration for informal contact should be weighed against the possible negative outcomes. An IP professional can help inform this decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Before talking to the other party, you should be satisfied that the other party’s actions would amount to infringement of your IP. This is something that an IP lawyer or an IP attorney can assist with.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>There can be serious consequences if you threaten a person with infringement proceedings on an incorrect basis, including a risk that the party may sue you.

This could jeopardise your IP rights.</span></li><li><span>For registered rights, it might prompt the other party to challenge the validity or registrability of your IP right in an attempt to undermine your claims. </span></li><li><span>In the case of trade marks, the other party may apply for a trade mark as a defensive strategy against your claims, and you may then need to decide if you wish to oppose their application.</span></li><li><span>Contacting the suspected infringer might give them time to hide or destroy evidence. This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, you should seek legal advice before communicating with the other party. </span></li><li><span>Depending on what you say to the other party, or what you might agree with them, this could impact your ability to take other enforcement action in future. <strong>It is usually prudent to tell the other party that any informal communications are on a ‘without prejudice’ basis and to include this in any written communications with them.</strong>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the possible outcomes?</span></h2><p><span>Informal communication with the other party can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the specific circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some possible outcomes are:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>The alleged infringing behaviour stops following the conversation, especially if the other party was simply unaware of existing IP rights.</span></li><li><span>The alleged infringer does not change their behaviour, in which case you may have to consider other enforcement options.</span></li><li><span>Parties can engage in further communication disputing part or all of your claims.</span></li><li><span>The alleged infringer is placed on notice that their conduct may involve infringement, which may assist you to seek monetary compensation if you later commence court action.</span></li><li><span>The conflict can further escalate into more serious, formal dispute settlement procedures (for example, sending a letter of demand, litigation, mediation, arbitration, administrative hearings.).</span></li><li><span>The other party may not fulfil all the requirements but may be willing to participate in some form of negotiation.</span></li><li><span>The other party may commence proceedings challenging the validity of the IP right, or be prompted to take legal action against you (for instance if they are of the opinion that you are infringing on their rights). This could include seeking damages or compensation for unjustified threats.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What might the costs be?</span></h2><p><span>If you engage an IP professional to give you legal advice or act on your behalf, fees will be incurred for their service.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Fees for IP professionals vary depending on the complexity of the issues at hand and which type of IP professional you engage. For instance, you can expect an average fee of $500-1000 per hour for a patent or trade mark attorney. &nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-AU">How much time might be involved?</span></h2><p><span>Informal communication can be a quick and simple enforcement option. However, the amount of time involved in communicating with the other party will vary depending on things like the complexity of the case, whether you choose to engage an IP professional to act on your behalf, and the response of the other party. &nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-AU">Who can use this?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Someone who owns IP (or in limited cases authorised user) and can provide evidence of their rights. &nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN-AU">Who’s involved?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li><span>IP right owner/s or authorised users or exclusive licensees of IP.</span></li><li><span>Alleged infringer(s).</span></li><li><span>(Optional) IP professionals acting on parties’ behalf.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What do you need to proceed?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span lang="EN-AU">Understanding what constitutes IP infringement, and possible consequences of contacting a suspected infringer, can help you decide if this is the right option for you.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU">It's important to get all the factual details correct and evaluate the merits of your claims before you reach out to the other party. <strong>Making unjustified claims of IP infringement can have serious consequences.
