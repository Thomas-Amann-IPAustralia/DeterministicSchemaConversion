If this happens, you will have the opportunity to defend your application by responding to the trade mark opposition.</p><p>After your trade mark application is formally <em>accepted&nbsp;</em>by IP Australia, there is a 2<span>-</span>month window in which someone can oppose the registration under various reasons outlined in the <em>Trade Marks Act</em>. There are many reasons for opposing registration, including that your trade mark is too similar to another<span>&nbsp;</span>trade mark, or that you applied to register your trade mark in bad faith.&nbsp;</p><p>Once your application has been opposed, you will have the opportunity to defend your application by responding to the trade mark opposition. If you do not defend your application, it will lapse and will not proceed to registration. You can respond to a trade mark opposition by lodging a <em>notice of intention to defend</em> at IP Australia. After this, parties to the opposition process submit relevant submissions and evidence to IP Australia and may request a written or oral hearing, or a written decision without a hearing before<span>&nbsp;</span>an IP Australia hearing officer, who will decide whether your mark can proceed to registration.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The process is generally less formal or costly than going to court. Parties to the opposition sometimes use this process to negotiate a settlement, such as limiting goods and services or agreeing to co-exist in the market.</p><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the benefits?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li>Defending your application from opposition prevents your application from lapsing automatically and gives you opportunities to present your argument and evidence as to why the application meets the requirements for registration.</li><li>Trade mark opposition and hearing processes are less formal and generally quicker than court proceedings in reaching an outcome.</li><li>The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.</li><li>You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time before the hearing officer has made a decision.<span>&nbsp;</span> This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.</li><li>Hearing officers have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.</li><li>The unsuccessful party may be required to pay the costs incurred by the other party during the opposition process. This does not, however, extend to commercial losses or damages.</li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the risks?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li>If your defence is unsuccessful or if you choose not to defend, your trade mark might fail to proceed to registration or might need to be amended in order to be registrable.</li><li>You might be required to pay the other party's costs.</li><li>Due to the public nature of this process there is a risk of public scrutiny, negative publicity or reputational damage.</li><li>If you decide to defend, you are choosing to engage with an administrative process with various stages of paperwork and requirements, each with deadlines and consequences for failing to meet the deadline. Failing to meet specific timeframes and submit documents and evidence in acceptable formats can jeopardise your defence.</li><li>Even if you are successful, the opponent can appeal the decision and take the matter to court. This will occur additional expenses.</li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the possible outcomes?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ol><li>Your trade mark achieving registration as applied for if your defence is upheld, or<ul><li>The opposition being upheld, and your trade mark fails to achieve registration, or<ul><li>It is also possible that the opposition was only raised in relation to part of the goods and services claimed under the trade mark, or the hearing officer considers that your defence or the other party’s opposition is only partially established. In this case, your trade mark may still achieve registration for part of the goods and services you have specified in your application.</li></ul></li><li>The opponent withdraws or abandons the opposition, including if you reach a settlement or the matter resolves commercially before a final decision is made.</li></ul></li><li>You withdraw your trade mark application.</li><li>If you choose not to defend your application against the opposition, your application will lapse.</li></ol><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What might the costs be?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li>There is no fee for filing a <em>notice of intention to defend.&nbsp;</em>However, extensions of time and other processes may incur further costs.
