It can be a preventative method used prior to an actual dispute, where parties may have encountered a roadblock. It can also be used in early stages of disputes, when parties fail to reach a resolution on their own. Lastly, you may even engage in mediation during more formal dispute resolution processes (that is, litigation or arbitration). &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While mediation can be ordered by court, it is often a voluntary process whereby disputing parties agree to negotiate an outcome with help from a mediator. Parties can discuss the suitability of mediation as a method to resolve their IP dispute and agree to participate in the process via different ways, including communicating directly through telephone discussions, email correspondence or instructing their legal representatives to do so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mediation is an attractive option for parties who: &nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>place a premium on the preservation or enhancement of their relationship, for instance when parties have an existing contractual or business relationship</span></li><li><span>seek to maintain control over the dispute settlement process, with some flexibility to shape the mediation procedures without procedural rules being imposed by others</span></li><li><span>value confidentiality, or </span></li></ul><p><span>want to reach a speedy settlement without damage to their reputations. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>When is mediation not appropriate? </strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mediation isn’t for everyone.

This can include entering into a legally binding agreement that incorporates some or all of the outcomes from the mediation, provided the parties clearly intend and agree to it.</span></li><li><span>Other enforcement processes often expect you to have negotiated in good faith before escalating (for example, a court is likely to require mediation be attempted before hearing a case).&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the risks?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li><span>Relies on genuine engagement and willingness of parties to resolve issues.</span></li><li><span>Facilitators may not have an adequate skillset for resolving complex intellectual property disputes.</span></li><li><span>Outcomes may not be as easily enforceable as court or tribunal decisions, especially when parties have not clearly indicated that the outcome of the mediation is to be legally binding.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the possible outcomes?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Possible outcomes include:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>One party does not agree to engage in mediation</span></li><li><span>Parties successfully negotiate and reach an agreement to resolve a dispute with help from a mediator</span></li><li><span>Parties unable to reach an agreement and withdraw from the mediation process, with the possibility of one or more parties escalating the matter to other dispute resolution processes.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span>What might the costs be?</span></h2><p><span>The costs of mediation will typically include:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Mediator's fee</span></li><li><span>Travel expenses and venue costs (if in person, though online mediation is increasingly common)</span></li><li><span>Administrative expenses (that is, document preparation, correspondence, etc.).&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>The primary cost in mediation process is the mediator’s fee.
