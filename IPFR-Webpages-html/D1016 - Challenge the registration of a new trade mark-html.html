</a><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the benefits?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">Initiating this process allows you to draw attention to factors which may have been overlooked in the examination process or other issues which may not have been allowed to be considered during examination.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The hearing officer has the power to award</span><em><span lang="EN-AU"> costs</span></em><span lang="EN-AU"> against a party to help recoup some of the costs incurred by the other party during the opposition process. This does not, however, extend to any losses or damages.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Hearing officers in IP Australia have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The process is accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Trade mark opposition and hearing processes are more informal and generally quicker than court proceedings in reaching an outcome.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the risks?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">If your opposition action is unsuccessful and the trade mark is registered, you may also be required to pay the other party's costs.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">When opposing the registration of a trade mark, the applicant will be notified of your opposition. You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the applicant be aware of you and your business.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Due to the public nature of this process there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to take enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy. </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.  </span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">It is possible that opposing a registration of a trade mark can alert the other party to your claims and can cause them to act more defensively or even contest your own rights.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">Using this process improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">If you are late in providing evidence, you can request an extension to the evidence submission timeframe. However, these can be difficult to obtain. You will need to demonstrate strong grounds for the extension and pay additional fees to IP Australia when you make the request. These fees are not refundable even if the extension isn’t granted.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">If you are successful in opposing registration of a trade mark, the denied applicant may appeal the decision</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What are the possible outcomes?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ol><li><span lang="EN-AU">The other party does not contest your opposition to their registration, and the trade mark application does not get registered.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">The other party contests your argument and defends their application in an opposition and hearings process, resulting in:</span><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">achieving registration, advertised amendment or extension of time in favour of their position, or</span></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">your opposition being upheld, and the other party fails to achieve registration, advertised amendment or extension of time.</span></li></ul></li><li><span lang="EN-AU">IP Australia doesn’t accept your application to oppose an accepted trade mark when your application does not meet formal or legal requirements.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol><h2><span lang="EN-AU">What might the cost be?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li><span lang="EN-AU">The fees to IP Australia will typically cost $650.
