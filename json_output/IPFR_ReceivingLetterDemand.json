It’s often the first formal step used in notifying someone of an IP issue. \n\nIt can be shocking to receive a legal letter like this, and the emotional impact should not be underestimated. Take time to carefully read the information to ensure you understand the other business’ or IP right owner’s concerns. Some important things to identify are: \n\n* which IP right the sender claims has been used without permission (‘infringed’)\n* what the sender wants you to do (for example, halting sales or removing content)\n* what evidence the sender has given in support of their claim.\n\nIt is usually not a good idea to ignore a letter of demand without first seeking professional advice. Taking time to understand their perspective may help you decide whether to negotiate, seek advice, or contest the claim. \n\nBefore responding to a letter of demand, you may want to show the letter and explain the situation to a qualified [IP legal professional](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/get-professional-assistance-with-your-IP)  who can explain your position and outline possible options.",

Signs that the letter may not be genuine include: * **No clear sender** — The letter lacks the sender’s name, firm or contact details. * **No specific IP right mentioned** — There is no trade mark, patent or design number, or information or evidence to support their claim of copyright. * **Fake IP right number (for registered rights)** — The IP right number provided is not published on the IP register (but you need to be careful to make sure you are checking the correct register). * **Poor grammar or formatting** — Scam letters often contain multiple typos or formatting issues. * **Overly aggressive or urgent tone** — Extreme threats or unrealistically short deadlines can be intimidation tactics. * **Demands for payment to unknown accounts** — You are asked to pay quickly to unfamiliar or overseas bank details. * **No evidence provided** — Genuine letters usually attach screenshots, product photos or other proof of the alleged infringement. * **Threats about confidentiality**— While there are often reasonable requests to keep the letter confidential, this can also be used as an intimidation tactic. However, a letter of demand may not be a scam even if it has some of the features listed above. If you are not sure, it may be advisable to speak to an IP lawyer or IP attorney about the letter you received."
