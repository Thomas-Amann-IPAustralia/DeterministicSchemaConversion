      "description": "If someone has accused you of copying or using their trade mark without permission, and the other party\u2019s trade mark is pending registration with IP Australia,\u00a0 you may be able to challenge their trade mark application\u00a0directly with IP Australia by initiating a trade mark opposition process. This process requires you to submit your supporting evidence and argument as to why the trade mark should not be registered.\n\nThere are several reasons on which a trade mark application can be opposed, including (but not limited to):\n\n* Similarity to an existing trade mark\n* Being too generic or descriptive\n* Containing a connotation that is misleading and confusing.\n\nIf your actions are successful, the\u00a0 other party will no longer have rights associated with the registration of their trade mark.\n\nObjections to the registration of a trade mark can typically only be raised within 2 months of its acceptance date being published. If this period has passed, you may need to explore other options.\n\nIf the application you wish to oppose is in the two-month window, you can file a \u2018Notice of Intention to Oppose'\u00a0 before it becomes registered. The opposition procedure can involve either a written or oral hearing, or a written decision without a hearing.",
