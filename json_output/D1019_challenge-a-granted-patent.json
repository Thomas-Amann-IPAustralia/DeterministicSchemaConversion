Notably, the re-examination process also allows the patent holder to amend their claims; in some cases, allowing them to circumvent the grounds on which the patent was challenged.  \n\nAnother significant risk associated with re-examination, is that the process is 'ex parte', meaning that after the initial submissions to the Patent Office, the challenging party is not involved in the proceedings at all. As such, if the outcome of the re-examination is not in favour of the challenging party, they have few options to refute the outcome (although, another re-examination can be requested). \n\nRequesting a re-examination will also inform the other party of your request, potentially harming professional relationships and increasing the possibility that the other party may act more defensively or even contest your own rights."
