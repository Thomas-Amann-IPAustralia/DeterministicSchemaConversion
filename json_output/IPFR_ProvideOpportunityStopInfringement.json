This is something that an IP lawyer or an IP attorney can assist with.\nThere can be serious consequences if you threaten a person with infringement proceedings on an incorrect basis, including a risk that the party may sue you. You might be liable to pay compensation or damages or you may be ordered to stop making the threat under '\n\nunjustified threat\n\n' provisions (also referred to as 'groundless threats' in copyright law).\nFor more information about what constitutes an infringement, see our information on \n\nwhat infringement can look like\n\n.\n\n \n\nAn IP professional can help you make this assessment.\nPlease note\n\n \n\nt\n\nhat engaging in any informal contact with the other party before consulting with an IP professional can result in detrimental outcomes for you and your IP right.

This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, you should seek legal advice before communicating with the other party.\n\n* Depending on what you say to the other party, or what you might agree with them, this could impact your ability to take other enforcement action in future.
