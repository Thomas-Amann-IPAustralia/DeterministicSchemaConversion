This could jeopardise your IP rights.\n* For registered rights, it might prompt the other party to challenge the validity or registrability of your IP right in an attempt to undermine your claims.\n* In the case of trade marks, the other party may apply for a trade mark as a defensive strategy against your claims, and you may then need to decide if you wish to oppose their application.\n* Contacting the suspected infringer might give them time to hide or destroy evidence. This could harm your case in future legal actions. If you are worried about this possibility, you should seek legal advice before communicating with the other party.\n* Depending on what you say to the other party, or what you might agree with them, this could impact your ability to take other enforcement action in future. **It is usually prudent to tell the other party that any informal communications are on a \u2018without prejudice\u2019 basis and to include this in any written communications with them.**"
