People choose not to actively pursue enforcement actions for several reasons including: \n\n- the infringer is inconsequential\n- the infringement has little risk of confusing your customers\n- there is low risk of damaging your brand or business\n- there can be reputational risk in taking action\n- the chances of successful enforcement are low compared to the costs involved.\n\nIt is important to take a holistic approach to addressing infringement which considers several factors: \n\n- the details of your IP rights\n- your current business situation and objectives\n- your personal circumstances\n- the nature and potential consequences of the infringement.\n\nIt can feel very personal when someone is infringing on your intellectual property - and it is important to acknowledge any emotional response you have to the situation - but choosing to take no action (as part of a thought-out IP strategy) can be a valid and rational choice. \n\nIt can be helpful to speak to an IP professional to help you develop an overall IP strategy, which makes it easier to decide when and how to respond to different types of infringement, as well as taking pro-active steps to prevent future infringement.",

This helps you budget and prepare for if you do decide to move forward.\n- Identify which type of IP professional you would consult if you choose to act. Consider having initial conversations to understand their services and approach.\n- Keep documentation of the infringement, including dates and evidence, to maintain a strong foundation if you choose to take action in the future."
