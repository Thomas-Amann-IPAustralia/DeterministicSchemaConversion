This can include entering into a legally binding agreement that incorporates some or all of the outcomes from the mediation, provided the parties clearly intend and agree to it.\n- Other enforcement processes often expect you to have negotiated in good faith before escalating (for example, a court is likely to require mediation be attempted before hearing a case)."

            "text": "Before you engage in mediation, you should think about whether mediation is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and what kind of mediator would suit your needs best. \n\nHow do I choose the right mediator? \n\nIt can be helpful to consider these questions when selecting a mediator to help ensure they are right for you:   \n\n1. Would the parties like the mediator to provide a neutral evaluation of their dispute, or act as a facilitator of their negotiations?\n2. What are the desirable professional qualifications and specialist experience of the mediator?\n3. Is it more important for the mediator to have experience in the subject matter of the dispute, or the process of mediation itself?\n4. Is more than one mediator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a mediation specialist as co-mediators?\n5. Does a conflict of interest exist?\n\nThere is a wide range of mediation providers, ranging from government and public-funded bodies to private practitioners. Here's a list of directories and mediation providers that may assist you in finding a mediator you would like to engage:  \n\n- The Resolution Institute's Dispute Resolver Directory list\n- The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO)  provides small business and family enterprises with information about dispute resolution options, access to mediation and alternative dispute resolution processes.\n- The World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center  offers mediation, arbitration and expert determination to enable private parties to settle their international commercial disputes. For more information, see WIPO ADR Options.\n- the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration\n- the Mediator Standards Board\n- the Australian Disputes Centre\n\nThe Small Business Commissions in most states and territories can also assist with resolving business related disputes. They offer a variety of services to assist small business including low-cost mediation services.  \n\n- Victorian Small Business Commission\n- New South Wales Small Business Commissioner\n- South Australian Small Business Commissioner\n- Western Australia Small Business Development Corporation\n- Queensland Small Business Commissioner\n\nFor some types of disputes related to copyright or licensing, there may be specialist dispute resolution services available. For example:\n\n- the Arts Law Centre of Australia has access to a panel of mediators and experts who can provide low-cost ADR services to artists and arts organisations who subscribe to Arts Law.\n- Resolution Pathways is a service available to music creators and music users disputing their interactions with~~,~~ APRA AMCOS and/or OneMusic Australia, as well as, in limited circumstances, disputes between music creators.\n\nYou can also seek help from IP professionals to obtain advice on whether ADR would be suitable for your situation and represent you throughout an ADR process. You can find a qualified IP attorney to assist you at: Find an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board."
