This may include general lawyers, IP lawyers, or specialist attorneys (such as patent or trade mark attorneys).\u00a0\n\nHiring a legal professional does not guarantee that you will win a dispute, but it may give you confidence that your rights are being taken seriously and your next steps are well considered.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s what you can generally expect:\u00a0\n\n* They can help you understand if what\u2019s happening may be a suspected infringement and what options are available.\n* They may draft or review documents such as letters of demand, agreements, or court submissions.\n* Some are also qualified to represent you in court or at hearings.\n* Attorneys (such as patent and trade mark attorneys) are specially trained in certain IP rights and may help with applications, oppositions, or enforcement; though not all attorneys are lawyers.\n\nYou should ask early about the costs, timing, and what\u2019s included in their services. Some professionals charge a fixed fee, while others bill hourly.\u00a0\n\n**Please note:** Trade mark and patent attorneys are not technically lawyers, but they are qualified to give advice on specific IP rights under Australian law.",
