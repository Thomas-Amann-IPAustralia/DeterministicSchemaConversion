If an IP lawyer needs to engage a barrister to represent you in court proceedings, this will add to the costs involved.\n\nSome IP lawyers and IP attorneys offer a free initial consultation to assess what services you need and to provide you with an estimate of costs moving forward. The Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia provides a service for free consultations. That service can be found [here](https://ipta.org.au/community/get-free-consultation/). It can be a good idea to ask for an indication of how much the entire process may cost during your first meeting. IP lawyers have a professional obligation to provide you with an upfront estimate of their fees and costs."
