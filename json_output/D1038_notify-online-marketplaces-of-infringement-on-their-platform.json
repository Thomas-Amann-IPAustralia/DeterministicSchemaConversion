      "text": "Online platforms such as e-commerce platforms, social media sites and digital advertising providers provide an excellent mechanism to promote and sell your products to consumers around the world. However, a lot of infringing and counterfeiting activities occur in this space as well, which can undermine legitimate brands and damage their reputation. This can also include selling, reproducing or making available copies of material that is subject to copyright. The 'intermediaries' have a responsibility not to facilitate infringement.    \n\nIf you notice infringement on a website or online platform, you can approach the owners of the site to request that they take down infringing content. To find out who owns a website, you can check their domain name's registration in the Australian  and international WHOIS databases. \n\nMost e-commerce platforms and major digital advertisers/search engine providers have a notice and take-down mechanism for handling IP complaints, including those concerning counterfeit goods and material that infringes copyright. \n\nYou can be proactive by listing your IP rights with different e-commerce platforms before anyone tries to sell counterfeit goods. Some platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, invite you to add your trade marks and other kinds of IP rights to a brand registry. This is used in automated checks to detect infringing goods before they are even listed for sale. \n\nNote: It can be time-consuming for rights owners to monitor e-commerce platforms and submit IP complaints themselves. A time and cost-effective way to manage this process is often to engage IP professionals such as IP monitoring services. These IP professionals can use their experience and knowledge to identify and remove counterfeit goods across multiple online platforms.Beyond online marketplaces, many other digital platforms available to Australian users (including social media platforms to which users can upload content) also offer mechanisms that copyright owners can use to address or prevent infringement. These often include complaint forms and notice and takedown processes that copyright owners can use if they believe their rights have been infringed. They may also include bespoke tools copyright owners can choose use to proactively manage and enforce their rights on those platforms. For example,  automated content recognition/identification or screening tools (like YouTube Content ID or Meta Rights Manager) allow copyright owners to upload their content and find matches to content uploaded on platforms by third parties. Where matches are found, copyright owners may be able to seek to pre-emptively block or otherwise monetise the content (for example, through share of advertising revenue in some cases).",

            "text": "If you have detected infringement on an online platform, it is worth checking several platforms (such as all those listed above) to see if infringement is taking place elsewhere. \n\nDifferent online platforms have different requirements for making IP complaints and takedown requests. \n\nYou will usually need: \n\n- Evidence such as screenshots, product listings, and any other documentation that clearly demonstrates the infringement. Refer to Evidence you can collect about infringements.\n- Evidence that you are the legitimate owner of the IP. Some platforms require you to have a registered IP right for you to access their brand protection and complaint mechanisms. You may consider applying for a registered IP right to access these procedures and prevent future infringements and protect your ideas, products and branding.\n\nNote that if you do not provide sufficiently accurate information, your takedown application may be rejected and the whole process would be delayed. \n\nFor matters involving copyright infringement online, before issuing a takedown notice, copyright owners should check that the user does not have a valid reason to use the material in question (for example a valid license or a 'fair dealing' use permitted as an exception to copyright under the Copyright Act). More information about when using copyright material is allowed is provided on the copyright infringement page."
