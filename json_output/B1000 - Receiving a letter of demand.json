It\u2019s often the first formal step used in notifying someone of an IP issue.\n\nIt can be shocking to receive a legal letter like this, and the emotional impact should not be underestimated. Take time to carefully read the information to ensure you understand the other business\u2019 or IP right owner\u2019s concerns. Some important things to identify are:\n\n* which IP right the sender claims has been used without permission (\u2018infringed\u2019)\n* what the sender wants you to do (for example, halting sales or removing content)\n* what evidence the sender has given in support of their claim.\n\nIt is usually not a good idea to ignore a letter of demand without first seeking professional advice. Taking time to understand their perspective may help you decide whether to negotiate, seek advice, or contest the claim.\n\n**Before responding to a letter of demand, you may want to show the letter and explain the situation to a qualified** [**IP legal professional**](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/get-professional-assistance-with-your-IP) **who can explain your position and outline possible options.**"

            "text": "Here are common features of these letters:\n\n* **Heading and sender details** \u2014 The letter should identify who sent the letter (whether the rights holder or their representative). You may want to verify their authority and ensure the letter was addressed to the right person or business. Some useful starting points include the [Trans-Tasman IP Attorney registry](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm) and the [ABN lookup tool](https://abr.business.gov.au/).\n* **Description of the alleged infringement** \u2014 Explains which IP rights are involved (for example trade mark number, patent number, specific item of copyright material and so on), identifies the sender\u2019s ownership of the right (or if they do not own the right themselves, it identifies the other basis on which they make the claim \u2013 for example if they have an exclusive license) and what actions you took that the sender claims infringe their IP rights.\n* **Demand to stop the activity** \u2014 Usually includes a list of things that the sender wants you to do in response to their letter, such as taking something down from a website, stopping selling a product, changing branding or marketing, or paying them compensation.\n* **Deadline for compliance** \u2014 Often includes a time limit for responding to their demands (for example, from 7 to 30 days) after which they may decide to start legal action against you.\n* **Evidence or exhibits** \u2014 May include screenshots, photos, links or documents.\n* **Consequences of non-compliance** \u2014 Often warns of possible court action, damages or injunctions. This is a common inclusion but doesn\u2019t mean legal action will immediately or definitely follow.\n* **Reservation of rights** \u2014 A general phrase keeping the sender\u2019s legal options open.\n* **Contact details for discussion** \u2014 Gives you a way to reply or negotiate.\n\n**Note:** While you should not ignore a letter of demand, you may not need to respond to the demand immediately ([Choose not to respond immediately](/options/choose-not-respond-immediately \"Choose not to respond immediately\")), nor do you need to [personally respond](/options/de-escalate-and-resolve-disputes-informally) or simply comply to their demands . It may be advisable to [speak to an IP lawyer or IP attorney](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/obtain-legal-advice-your-situation) about the letter of demand. They can advise you on next steps and also communicate on your behalf."

If you are not sure, it may be advisable to speak to an IP lawyer or IP attorney about the letter you received."
