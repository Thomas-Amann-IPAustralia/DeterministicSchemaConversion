            "text": "In the context of intellectual property (IP) protection, a letter of demand (or a cease and desist letter) is a formal notice from someone who believes you are using their IP without permission. It's often the first formal step used in notifying someone of an IP issue.\nIt can be shocking to receive a legal letter like this, and the emotional impact should not be underestimated. Take time to carefully read the information to ensure you understand the other business' or IP right owner's concerns. Some important things to identify are:\n* which IP right the sender claims has been used without permission ('infringed')\n\n* what the sender wants you to do (for example, halting sales or removing content)\n\n* what evidence the sender has given in support of their claim.\nIt is usually not a good idea to ignore a letter of demand without first seeking professional advice. Taking time to understand their perspective may help you decide whether to negotiate, seek advice, or contest the claim.\n**Before responding to a letter of demand, you may want to show the letter and explain the situation to a qualified**\n\nIP legal professional\n\n**who can explain your position and outline possible options.**"

            "text": "Here are common features of these letters:\n* **Heading and sender details**- The letter should identify who sent the letter (whether the rights holder or their representative). You may want to verify their authority and ensure the letter was addressed to the right person or business. Some useful starting points include theTrans-Tasman IP Attorney registryand theABN lookup tool.\n\n* **Description of the alleged infringement**- Explains which IP rights are involved (for example trade marknumber, patent number, specific item of copyright material and so on), identifies the sender's ownership of the right (or if they do not own the right themselves, it identifies the other basis on which they make the claim - for example if they have an exclusive license) and what actions you took that the sender claims infringe their IP rights.\n\n* **Demand to stop the activity**- Usually includes a list of things that the sender wants you to do in response to their letter, such as taking something down from a website, stopping selling a product, changing branding or marketing, or paying them compensation.\n\n* **Deadline for compliance**- Often includes a time limit for responding to their demands (for example, from 7 to 30 days) after which they may decide to start legal action against you.\n\n* **Evidence or exhibits**- May include screenshots, photos, links or documents.\n\n* **Consequences of non-compliance**- Often warns of possible court action, damages or injunctions. This is a common inclusion but doesn't mean legal action will immediately or definitely follow.\n\n* **Reservation of rights**- A general phrase keeping the sender's legal options open.\n\n* **Contact details for discussion**- Gives you a way to reply or negotiate.\n**Note:**\n\n While you should not ignore a letter of demand, you may not need to respond to the demand immediately (\n\n[Choose not to respond immediately](/options/choose-not-respond-immediately)\n\n), nor do you need to \n\n[personally respond](/options/de-escalate-and-resolve-disputes-informally)\n\n or simply comply to their demands . It may be advisable to \n\nspeak to an IP lawyer or IP attorney\n\nabout the letter of demand. They can advise you on next steps and also communicate on your behalf."

            "text": "Some cease and desist letters may be \n\nmisleading or sent in bad faith\n\n. Signs that the letter may not be genuine include:\n* **No clear sender**- The letter lacks the sender's name, firm or contact details.\n\n* **No specific IP right mentioned**- There is no trade mark, patent or design number, or information or evidence to support their claim of copyright.\n\n* **Fake IP right number (for registered rights)**- The IP right number provided is not published on the IP register (but you need to be careful to make sure you are checking the correct register).\n\n* **Poor grammar or formatting**- Scam letters often contain multiple typos or formatting issues.\n\n* **Overly aggressive or urgent tone**- Extreme threats or unrealistically short deadlines can be intimidation tactics.\n\n* **Demands for payment to unknown accounts**- You are asked to pay quickly to unfamiliar or overseas bank details.\n\n* **No evidence provided**- Genuine letters usually attach screenshots, product photos or other proof of the alleged infringement.\n\n* **Threats about confidentiality**- While there are often reasonable requests to keep the letter confidential, this can also be used as an intimidation tactic.\nHowever, a letter of demand may not be a scam even if it has some of the features listed above. If you are not sure, it may be advisable to speak to an IP lawyer or IP attorney about the letter you received."
