You may want to verify their authority and ensure the letter was addressed to the right person or business. Some useful starting points include the <a href=\"https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm\"><u>Trans-Tasman IP Attorney registry</u> </a> and the <a href=\"https://abr.business.gov.au/\"><u>ABN lookup tool</u> </a>.</li><li><strong>Description of the alleged infringement</strong> - Explains which IP rights are involved (for example trade mark number, patent number, specific item of copyright material and so on), identifies the sender's ownership of the right (or if they do not own the right themselves, it identifies the other basis on which they make the claim - for example if they have an exclusive license) and what actions you took that the sender claims infringe their IP rights. </li><li><strong>Demand to stop the activity</strong> - Usually includes a list of things that the sender wants you to do in response to their letter, such as taking something down from a website, stopping selling a product, changing branding or marketing, or paying them compensation.</li><li><strong>Deadline for compliance</strong> - Often includes a time limit for responding to their demands (for example, from 7 to 30 days) after which they may decide to start legal action against you.</li><li><strong>Evidence or exhibits</strong> - May include screenshots, photos, links or documents.</li><li><strong>Consequences of non-compliance</strong> - Often warns of possible court action, damages or injunctions. This is a common inclusion but doesn't mean legal action will immediately or definitely follow.</li><li><strong>Reservation of rights</strong> - A general phrase keeping the sender's legal options open.</li><li><strong>Contact details for discussion</strong> - Gives you a way to reply or negotiate. </li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> While you should not ignore a letter of demand, you may not need to respond to the demand immediately (<a href=\"/options/choose-not-respond-immediately\">Choose not to respond immediately</a>), nor do you need to <a href=\"/options/de-escalate-and-resolve-disputes-informally\">personally respond</a> or simply comply to their demands .
