You can oppose the registration of a trade mark if you believe that an accepted trade mark would impact your existing trade mark or otherwise impact your or the public interest. Some oppositions move to a hearing, conducted by neutral experts within IP Australia. \n\nThere are several reasons on which a trade mark application can be opposed, including (but not limited to):  \n\n* similarity to an existing trade mark\n* being too generic or descriptive\n* containing a connotation that is misleading and confusing.\n\nOpposition processes can also be used for opposing other types of IP Australia decisions such as applications for removal, advertised amendments to trade marks and certain extensions of time proposed by IP Australia. \n\nObjections to the registration of a trade mark can typically only be raised within 2 months of its acceptance date being published. If this period has passed, you may need to explore other options. \n\n[](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement?utm_content=NotSure_button_experiment_v1)"

However, these can be difficult to obtain. You will need to demonstrate strong grounds for the extension and pay additional fees to IP Australia when you make the request.

You should consider your overall strategy and if you are comfortable having the applicant be aware of you and your business.\n Due to the public nature of this process there is a risk of public scrutiny, exposure of sensitive information, negative publicity or reputational damage. The decision to take enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy.\n There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.\n It is possible that opposing a registration of a trade mark can alert the other party to your claims and can cause them to act more defensively or even contest your own rights.\n Using this process improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.\n If you are late in providing evidence, you can request an extension to the evidence submission timeframe. However, these can be difficult to obtain. You will need to demonstrate strong grounds for the extension and pay additional fees to IP Australia when you make the request. These fees are not refundable even if the extension isn't granted.\n If you are successful in opposing registration of a trade mark, the denied applicant may appeal the decision"
