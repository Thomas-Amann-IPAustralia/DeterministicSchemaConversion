This does not, however, extend to any losses or damages. * Hearing officers in IP Australia have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law. * The process is accessible without professional assistance required, though IP professionals are commonly used. * Trade mark opposition and hearing processes are more informal and generally quicker than court proceedings in reaching an outcome. * The process allows parties to request a cooling-off period or temporary suspension of the process to engage in negotiations and settlement, should they wish to resolve the dispute that way. * You can withdraw from the opposition process at any time. This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached."

However, these can be difficult to obtain. You will need to demonstrate strong grounds for the extension and pay additional fees to IP Australia when you make the request.
