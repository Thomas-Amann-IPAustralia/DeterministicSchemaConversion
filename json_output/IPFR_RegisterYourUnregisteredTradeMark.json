It might be a logo, phrase, word, letter, colour, sound, smell, picture, movement, aspect of packaging or any combination of these. \n\nYou might have some rights to protect your trade mark even if it’s not registered with IP Australia.

It provides: * Exclusive legal rights to use the trade mark commercially (on the goods and services claimed). * Robust and universally recognised registration (within Australia). * Clear evidence of ownership date to support your claims. * Strong negotiating position for settlement discussions. Some enforcement options are only available if your trade mark is registered. These include the ability to take action against infringement under the *Trade Marks 1995*, and the ability to lodge an objection to imports of trade mark-infringing goods at the border under the Australian Border Force (ABF) Notice of Objection scheme. Registration can also make it easier to commercialise and licence your trade mark, and for others to be aware that you claim the rights. Your trade mark will appear on a public, searchable database showing your claim and its scope."

Your competitors might become aware you are trying to register your trade mark. They may take actions like trying to register their own similar trade mark, or oppose your application. * You might discover that there is a problem with your trade mark, or that someone else has already registered a similar trade mark. This could mean you need to reconsider whether your trade mark is right for you. * An Australian trade mark registration does not cover you in overseas markets."
