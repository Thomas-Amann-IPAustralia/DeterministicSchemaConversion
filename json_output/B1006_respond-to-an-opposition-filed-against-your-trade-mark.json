This allows parties to start and continue negotiation throughout the opposition process and agree to withdraw from the process if a settlement is reached.\n- Hearing officers have a high level of expertise, experience and authority in the field of trade mark law.\n- The unsuccessful party may be required to pay the costs incurred by the other party during the opposition process.
