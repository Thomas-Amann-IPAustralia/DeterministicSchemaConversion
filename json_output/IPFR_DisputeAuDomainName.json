The resolution provider will notify the domain name holder within 3 days of receiving your compliant application and the required payment. They will then be allowed up to 20 days to provide a response. Otherwise, the decision will be made based on the information you initially provided.  Once a response has been received or the deadline has passed, panel members will be appointed, and a decision will be made within 24 days which will be communicated to you, the other party and the provider of the disputed domain.  If the panel decides that the disputed domain name should be transferred or cancelled, the domain provider is required to wait 10 business days before fulfilling the decision. This gives you or the other party the option to commence legal proceedings."
