If you believe someone’s .au domain name licence is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can lodge a dispute with one of two independent resolution providers under auDA’s .au Dispute Resolution Policy (auDRP). This can result in cancellation or transfer of the .au domain name licence.   \n\nA panel of independent arbitrators and legal practitioners will consider submissions from both parties and provide their decision with reasoning, in writing. There are usually no in-person hearings and the panel’s decisions are binding on both parties. \n\nPlease Note: If the infringing domain name does not end in ‘.au’ then you might consider accessing a different dispute resolution service like one under the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP).",

They will then be allowed up to 20 days to provide a response. Otherwise, the decision will be made based on the information you initially provided.\nOnce a response has been received or the deadline has passed, panel members will be appointed, and a decision will be made within 24 days which will be communicated to you, the other party and the provider of the disputed domain.\nIf the panel decides that the disputed domain name should be transferred or cancelled, the domain provider is required to wait 10 business days before fulfilling the decision.
