This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the accuser has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices.\n* The identity and contact details of the other party - it's important to make sure you speak to the correct party.\n\nThroughout the negotiation with the other party, it can be helpful to remember to:  \n\n* Stay calm and professional throughout the conversation, avoiding emotional, accusatory language.\n* Focus on the issues at hand, not the personalities of the other parties involved.\n* Acknowledge that problems are often caused by misunderstanding or oversight, and that a mutually beneficial outcome can be reached.\n* Be clear on the terms of agreement you may reach with the other party, writing down the agreement in detail at the end of the conversation.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whether you will be able to leverage a commercially meaningful outcome from the IP dispute you are facing and if you can have a productive, amicable discussion with the other party. An IP professional can help you make this assessment and advise which steps might work best in your situation."

            "text": "It's important to get all the factual details right and evaluate the merits of the claims before you respond to the other party. Here are some things you might want to check and consider before talking to the other party:  \n\n The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where the alleged infringement occurred. This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the accuser has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices.\n The identity and contact details of the other party - it's important to make sure you speak to the correct party.\n\nThroughout the negotiation with the other party, it can be helpful to remember to:  \n\n Stay calm and professional throughout the conversation, avoiding emotional, accusatory language.\n Focus on the issues at hand, not the personalities of the other parties involved.\n Acknowledge that problems are often caused by misunderstanding or oversight, and that a mutually beneficial outcome can be reached.\n Be clear on the terms of agreement you may reach with the other party, writing down the agreement in detail at the end of the conversation.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whether you will be able to leverage a commercially meaningful outcome from the IP dispute you are facing and if you can have a productive, amicable discussion with the other party. An IP professional can help you make this assessment and advise which steps might work best in your situation."
