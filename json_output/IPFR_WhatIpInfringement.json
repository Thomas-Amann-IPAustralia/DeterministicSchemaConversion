            "text": "At its simplest, infringement occurs when someone uses another\u2019s protected creative work or invention without that person\u2019s permission or consent. Australian law gives creators and inventors legal protection and rights over their work. Australian IP law protects various types of intellectual creations. These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders\u2019 rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.\n\nWhen someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement.\n\nThink of it as using someone else\u2019s property without asking. Just as you would not use someone\u2019s car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.\n\n* [Trade mark infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/trade-mark-infringement)\n* [Patent infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/patent-infringement)\n* [Design infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/design-infringement)\n* [Plant Breeder's Rights (PBR) infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/plant-breeders-right-pbr-infringement)\n* [Copyright infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/copyright-infringement)\n* [Unregistered trade marks](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/unregistered-trade-marks)"

            "text": "IP infringement matters for several reasons:\n\n1. **For IP owners**: Someone using your IP without permission can damage your business, cost you money, and weaken the value of what you have created.\n2. **For businesses and creators**: Using someone else\u2019s protected IP without permission can lead to legal disputes, financial penalties, and damage to your reputation.\n3. **For everyone**: Australia\u2019s IP system tries to balance rewarding creators with allowing new ideas to flourish. Respecting IP rights helps maintain this balance."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "While different types of IP have their own specific rules, some common elements help determine if infringement might be occurring:\n\n**1. There must be protected intellectual property**\n\nFor infringement to occur, the creative work or invention must first be protected under the law. This means answering the question, \u2018What exactly is protected?\u2019 Different rules apply to different types of IP and protect only specific aspects of creation or innovation.\n\nSome types of IP, like patents, trade marks, and designs, must be officially registered with IP Australia to be protected. On the other hand, IP rights, such as copyright, are automatically protected when certain conditions are met.\n\nImportantly, IP rights must be in place that have not expired. The various IP rights last for different periods:\n\n* Patents generally last up to 20 years\n* Trade marks can last forever if renewed\n* Designs last a maximum of 10 years\n* Copyright lasts generally 70 years after the creator dies\n* Plant breeders\u2019 rights last up to 20 or 25 years, depending on the plant variety.\n\n**2. Someone used it without permission**\n\nThe person or business must use the protected IP without proper permission (commonly called the alleged infringer). Without some form of \"yes, you can use this,\" using protected IP might be considered infringement. Permission might be granted through:\n\n* Written agreement allowing its use (called a licence)\n* Written agreement to transfer ownership (called an assignment)\n* Informal permission (verbal agreement or consent).\n\n**3. What they are using is too similar**\n\nWhen determining infringement, the material created or the activity of the alleged infringer is examined. The alleged infringing material or activity must be sufficiently similar to the protected IP to create a problem. How this is judged under the law depends on the type of IP involved. Different tests are applied to determine what constitutes a problematic level of similarity.\n\n* **For patents**: Are they using what a granted patent specifically describes and claims?\n* **For trade marks**: Are they using a trade mark that is too similar and likely to confuse customers, and is it being used on similar goods or services?\n* **For designs**: Does the product look too much like the protected design?\n* **For copyright**: Have they copied a substantial part of the original work?\n* **For plant breeders\u2019 rights**: Have they propagated or copied the protected plant variety?\n\n**4. How it is being used matters**\n\nHow the IP is used is an important factor in determining infringement though the requirements vary by the IP type:\n\n* **Trade marks**: To infringe a registered trade mark, someone needs to use something similar to the registered mark to brand or identify their products or services in the marketplace. Mentioning the brand name in conversation or for informational purposes, or in non-commercial contexts, is generally not infringement.\n* **Designs**: Infringement typically involves making, importing, selling, or using products that incorporate the protected design. While often commercial, infringement can occur in non-commercial contexts.\n* **Patents**: Infringement occurs when someone makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports the patented invention without permission.\n* **Plant breeders\u2019 rights**: Infringement is primarily in commercial contexts, involving production, reproduction, conditioning for propagation, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, or stocking of the protected plant variety.\n* **Copyright**: Copyright infringement can occur in both commercial and non-commercial situations. Copying, distributing, performing, or displaying copyrighted works without permission can be infringement.\n\n**5. When using someone\u2019s IP might be allowed**\n\nEven if someone is using IP in a way that appears to infringe, there may be legal defences or exceptions that allow their use. Each type of IP right has its own defences. Here are some common defences:\n\n* **Trade marks:** Using your own name in business is a defence.\n* **Patents**: Using a patented invention for experimental use, like research and testing, is a defence.\n* **Copyright:** Using copyright material for research or study, criticism or review, parody or satire, or news reporting are defences.\n* **Designs:** Making parts needed to repair a complex product is a defence.\n* **Plant breeders\u2019 rights**: Using a plant variety for the purpose of experimentation, further breeding, like cross breeding, or using the variety for private and non-commercial use."

Even without the intention to copy, this similarity could constitute infringement if it might confuse consumers about the source of the services.\n* **Example 2**: A manufacturer creates a product using a method that incorporates all the essential steps described in someone else\u2019s granted patent. This is likely infringement, even if they were unaware of the patent.\n* **Example 3**: A website copies an image from another website without asking for permission. This may constitute copyright infringement, even if the website provides a source for the image."

No fixed percentage change automatically avoids infringement.\n* **\u201cI didn't know they owned it\u201d**: Not knowing about someone else\u2019s IP rights usually is not a defence against infringement.\n* **\u201cI\u2019m not charging for it, so it\u2019s not infringement\u201d**: Even if you are not making money from it, using someone\u2019s IP without permission can still be infringement.\n* **\u201cI\u2019m giving credit to the creator\u201d**: Acknowledging the source of material does not necessarily avoid infringement.\n* **\"It\u2019s not registered, so I can use it \"**: Some IP rights, like copyright, do not require registration to be protected."
