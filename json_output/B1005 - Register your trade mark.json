It might be a logo, phrase, word, letter, colour, sound, smell, picture, movement, aspect of packaging or any combination of these.\nRegistering a trade mark can give you an exclusive right to use your branding on specific goods or services in Australia. Your trade mark will appear on a public, searchable database.\u202fThis may help you demonstrate your ownership if others allege you have copied their branding.\nYou might have some rights to protect your trade mark even if it's not registered with IP Australia.
