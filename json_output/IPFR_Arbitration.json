The hourly rate of an arbitrator would differ significantly depending on the amount in dispute and which arbitration/arbitral institution the parties choose. Due to the high legal and subject-matter expertise required of an arbitrator, the cost of engaging them can be extremely expensive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center provides that cases under the WIPO Expedited Arbitration Rules cost around\u00a0[US$48,000 and cases under the WIPO Arbitration Rules cost some US$165,000](https://www.wipo.int/web/wipo-magazine/articles/what-does-it-cost-to-defend-your-ip-rights-38493) \u00a0(48% of such cases involving a three member tribunal and 52% a sole arbitrator).\u00a0  While legal representation is optional, very often parties to the dispute would choose to engage legal professionals to give advice and represent them.
