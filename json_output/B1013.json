      "text": "Unjustified threats of IP infringement can disrupt your business, for example while you assess whether you can continue using the contested IP. If someone threatens to take legal action against you for infringing their Australian registered IP rights, and these threats are unjustified and received by you in Australia, you may be able to take action under Australia's 'unjustified threats' laws. Similarly, if someone threatens to take action against you in Australia for infringing copyright and these threats are unjustified, you may be able to take action under the 'groundless threats' provisions of Australian copyright law. \n\n If you receive or are affected by an unjustified threat, you can start legal action and ask a court to: \n\n* declare the threat unjustified\n* order the sender to stop making threats\n* award compensation for any losses.\n\n Some reasons a threat might be unjustified are:  \n\n* for registered IP rights - the accuser does not actually own a current, valid Australian IP right, and therefore is not entitled to take IP infringement action\n* the alleged infringement isn't occurring because, for example: the actions you've been accused of taking would not actually infringe IP rights under Australian law.\n\nIf someone makes a threat against you, they need to be able to show that the threat was justified if you decide to start legal action against them. However, is important to note that Australian IP laws make it clear that mere notification of registration or protection of IP rights, or the mere notification of the existence of a copyright, is not by itself a threat.  \n\nIt can be difficult to know whether a notice or correspondence amounts to an unjustified threat. An IP lawyer or IP attorney may be able to advise you on whether you have received an unjustified threat.  \n\n**It is always prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start legal action.**There are often options other than court for responding to an unjustified threat -- like writing back to the other party to clarify your position -- before you decide whether to start legal action against them. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you decide on the best way to respond. \n\n[](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement?utm_content=NotSure_button_experiment_v1)"

      "text": "**Consider whether the threat is unjustified** \n\nA key starting point can be to check the IP right registration status of the accuser (except for copyright, which in Australia does not have a formal registration system). You can search the Australian IP registers to check whether they have a current (not pending or expired) registered IP right. For design rights, the status must be listed as 'certified' (not simply registered) before they can enforce their design. \n\nReview your own use of the contested IP and consider whether this might amount to infringement. \n\nIt can be very difficult to determine whether a threat is unjustified as you will usually need to determine whether the allegations of infringement are accurate. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you with considering whether a threat is unjustified and how you might best respond. \n\n**Gather evidence** \n\nKeep evidence of the threat, including: \n\n* copies of the threat and any related emails or letters\n* evidence of how the threat has affected (or might affect) your business.\n\n**Consider getting help from an IP lawyer** \n\nStrongly consider the value of speaking to an IP lawyer. An IP lawyer can review the evidence, provide legal advice and represent you in court if the threat cannot be resolved in some other way.  \n\nGoing to court without legal representation is not advisable and, in some cases, a court will require that you have legal representation."

            "text": "Consider whether the threat is unjustified \n\nA key starting point can be to check the IP right registration status of the accuser (except for copyright, which in Australia does not have a formal registration system). You can search the Australian IP registers to check whether they have a current (not pending or expired) registered IP right. For design rights, the status must be listed as 'certified' (not simply registered) before they can enforce their design. \n\nReview your own use of the contested IP and consider whether this might amount to infringement. \n\nIt can be very difficult to determine whether a threat is unjustified as you will usually need to determine whether the allegations of infringement are accurate. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you with considering whether a threat is unjustified and how you might best respond. \n\nGather evidence \n\nKeep evidence of the threat, including: \n\n copies of the threat and any related emails or letters\n evidence of how the threat has affected (or might affect) your business.\n\nConsider getting help from an IP lawyer \n\nStrongly consider the value of speaking to an IP lawyer. An IP lawyer can review the evidence, provide legal advice and represent you in court if the threat cannot be resolved in some other way.  \n\nGoing to court without legal representation is not advisable and, in some cases, a court will require that you have legal representation."
