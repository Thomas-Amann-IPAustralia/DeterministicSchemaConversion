Some possible outcomes are:\n\n You might reach a negotiated settlement with the other party.\n The other party might not respond or participate in the court proceedings, in which case the court might decide in your favour.\n The other party's registered design might be cancelled or amended.\n The court might decide against you, in which case your registered design could be cancelled and you may need to pay some or all of the other party's legal costs.\n You could be awarded damages.\n A court may, in appropriate situations, make orders to prevent an infringer from continuing to infringe your design rights - including on a temporary basis while you are waiting for the court to hear your matter.\n A decision made by IP Australia can be affirmed, reversed or varied.\n Some other outcome depending on what you have claimed (including, for example, if you have made other legal claims under the Australian Consumer Law).\n* In most cases, the outcome can be appealed to a higher court."

Appeals cost anywhere from $150k-300k+.\n\nBecause of the lack of legal precedent for designs. It is likely that any designs dispute in court will be very expensive."

It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.\n\nConsider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim \\\nGoing to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.\n\nConsider the impact of publicity \\\nCourt proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.\n\nGather all your documents \\\nBefore seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review."
