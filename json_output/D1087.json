It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.\n\n**Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim**\u00a0\\\nGoing to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.\n\n**Consider the impact of publicity**\u00a0\\\nCourt proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.\n\n**Gather all your documents**\u00a0\\\nBefore seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review."
