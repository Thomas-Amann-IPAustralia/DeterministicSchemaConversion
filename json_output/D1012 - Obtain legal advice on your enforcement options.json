Alternatively, you could search the <a href=\"https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm\">Trans-Tasman IP Attorney Board </a>register as a starting point. </p><p><strong>How about other types of IP professionals?</strong> </p><p>The term IP professionals refers to a range of experts who can help you plan and manage your business in relation to IP, including legal professionals. If you are seeking advice on how to enforce your IP rights, and what might be most appropriate to your situation, you should seek it from an IP lawyer or other relevant legal professional. </p><p>If you wish to obtain support for other IP-related aspects of your business, you may wish to engage services provided by non-legal IP professionals such as: </p><ul><li>an accountant who specialises in IP marketing or commercialisation</li><li>a brand consultant</li><li>a franchise and export consultant</li><li>a management consultant</li><li>IP search firms</li><li>IP monitoring service providers</li><li>Government business support. </li></ul><p>If you are a copyright owner who is a member of a copyright collecting society or a professional organisation representing certain kinds of creator or creative business, you could explore whether that organisation is able to provide information or another form of assistance in your particular circumstances. </p>"
