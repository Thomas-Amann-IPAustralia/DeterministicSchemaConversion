      "text": "It is essential to recognise that trade mark protection has limitations. Let's say, for example, you registerfor coffee machines(listed under class 11) and coffee beans (listed under class 30). Potential infringement situations include:\n\n1. Clear infringement: Another business begins selling coffee machines using the name* The alleged infringing mark is being used as a trade mark (it is on the machine and advertising).\n   - The registered trade markand the alleged infringing markare identical.\n   - The alleged infringing mark is being used for identical products (coffee machines).\n2. Possible infringement: Another business starts selling coffee filters using.\n   - The business is usingas a trade mark (it is on the product packaging).\n   - The registered trade markand the alleged infringing marklook similar and sound similar. Consumers might be confused about where they came from.\n   - The mark is being used on related but not identical goods. Courts would consider how similar these goods are.\n3. Unlikely to be infringement: A company usesfor completely unrelated goods like gardening tools.\n   - The business is usingas a trade mark (it is on the product packaging).\n   - The marks are identical, but the company uses the trade mark on goods that differ from the registered trade mark.\n4. Not infringement: A coffee critique writes a review of the product entitled* The article's author is not using the wordas a trade mark.\n5. Not infringement: Another company uses a different coffee-related name, like, for coffee machines.\n   - The business is usingas a trade mark.\n   - However,and the registered trade markare too dissimilar.\n\nNavigating trade mark infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Additionally, the registered trade mark must be legally valid. A registered trade mark may be challenged in court and sought to be cancelled during a claim of infringement. An expert can help navigate these issues and provide advice. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n1.

The goods and services - those listed in the registration (see  Classes of Goods and Services  for more information).7\n\nProtection is generally limited to these combined elements.8 For example, a person will infringe a registered trade mark if they use a similar trade mark with the same or similar goods or services listed in the registration. In contrast, there may be no infringement if a similar sign is used for completely different goods or services.9\n\nHowever, the law does protect well-known trade marks in some cases.10 Infringement can occur when a well-known trade mark is used in relation to goods or services unrelated to the registered trade mark.11"

            "text": "Where a trade mark is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:\n\n1. Someoneuses a signThis is a crucial requirement. The infringer must use the sign as a 'badge of origin,'12 or in other words, to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services.13 This involves using the trade mark to identify or differentiate their products or services in the marketplace.14 This requirement limits infringement and allows for legitimate references to trade marks in contexts that do not suggest commercial origin.\n\nExamples of use as a trademark:\n\n- Applying the sign to product packaging or labels15\n- Using the sign in advertising to promote goods or services16\n- Displaying the sign on business signage or storefronts17\n- Using the sign on websites to market products18\n\nExamples that are not use as atrade mark:\n\n- Using a word in its ordinary descriptive sense (e.g., usingto refer to the fruit)19\n- Referring to a trade mark for informational purposes20\n- Using a sign purely for functional or decorative purposes21\n\n2. Someone uses an almost identical trade mark or one that is similar enough to confuse people\n\nThis is when someone uses a trade mark that resembles or sounds almost exactly like a registered trade mark,22 with only tiny differences that would go unnoticed by most consumers.\n\nFor example, suppose the wordis a registered trade mark for bedding products. In that case, using(just changing the spelling) for similar products would likely be considered too similar. Alternatively, someone uses a trade mark that, despite having some differences, is too similar to the registered trade mark. This similarity is likely to confuse consumers about who produces the product or provides the services.23 For instance, it may look or sound similar enough to a registered trade mark. \n\nFor example, ifwith a wave picture is a registered trade mark for surfboards (see below), usingwith a similar wave design for surf gear could confuse customers into thinking they are from the same company.\n\nWhen looking at possible trade mark infringement, courts compare the registered trade mark with the alleged infringing trade mark and consider:\n\n- How similar the trade marks look and sound24\n- The impression left by the trade marks25\n- Whether the trade marks convey the same idea26\n- Where and how the products are sold27\n- Whether the typical customer would take the time to notice differences28\n- Whether anyone has actually been confused.29\n\n3. Using the mark on the same or similar goodsor services\n\nLastly, the trade mark is used to sell goods or services that are the same or similar to those listed in the registered trade mark. Therefore, infringement can still occur even when the trade mark is used for goods or services that are not identical to those covered by a registered trade mark but are similar or closely related.30\n\nFor example, ifis registered for coffee, usingfor soft drinks might infringe because both products are related to non-alcoholic beverages.31 Customers might think the same company makes them.\n\nAgain, courts consider several factors when determining whether goods or services are similar or closely related.32\n\nAlternatively, infringement can occur when someone uses a 'well known' trade mark in relation to goods or services unrelated to those listed in the registration.33 However, this kind of infringement has not been heard much in court, and its scope is not currently clear."
