In some cases, the patent holder can also be added as a party to those proceedings, potentially leading to legal action or expense.\n\n* If you do not put in place arrangements to protect your sensitive commercial information (such as specific business practices or product features) during negotiations, it may be shared with other parties or misused by the recipient.\n\n* You may also need to consider the potential tax implications of the licence, particularly if you are operating in multiple jurisdictions."
