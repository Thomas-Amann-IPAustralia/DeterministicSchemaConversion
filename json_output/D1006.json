      "text": "Mediation is a widely used type of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process where a neutral third party, called a mediator, helps parties negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. Mediation is a flexible, straightforward and often very efficient method to resolving IP disputes.  \n\nMediation can be used at any stage during a dispute process. It can be a preventative method used prior to an actual dispute, where parties may have encountered a roadblock. It can also be used in early stages of disputes, when parties fail to reach a resolution on their own. Lastly, you may even engage in mediation during more formal dispute resolution processes (that is, litigation or arbitration).  \n\nWhile mediation can be ordered by court, it is often a voluntary process whereby disputing parties agree to negotiate an outcome with help from a mediator. Parties can discuss the suitability of mediation as a method to resolve their IP dispute and agree to participate in the process via different ways, including communicating directly through telephone discussions, email correspondence or instructing their legal representatives to do so. \n\nMediation is an attractive option for parties who:  \n\n* place a premium on the preservation or enhancement of their relationship, for instance when parties have an existing contractual or business relationship\n* seek to maintain control over the dispute settlement process, with some flexibility to shape the mediation procedures without procedural rules being imposed by others\n* value confidentiality, or\n\nwant to reach a speedy settlement without damage to their reputations.  \n\n**When is mediation not appropriate?** \n\nMediation isn't for everyone. Mediation may not be suitable when:  \n\n* one or both parties need an impartial opinion on a matter of difference, perhaps to set a precedent or to be vindicated publicly on an issue in dispute\n* a party is certain that it has a straightforward case to the extent that there is no room for settlement or negotiation\n* deliberate counterfeiting or piracy has occurred.\n\n[](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement?utm_content=NotSure_button_experiment_v1)"

      "text": "* Costs and duration of the process is generally quite low.\n* Mediation can be conducted across different jurisdictions.\n* Less adversarial than other procedures such as arbitration and court proceedings, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party by reducing emotional strain and preventing the discussions from being too heated.\n* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.\n* Parties can narrow the scope of a dispute to the issues that matter to both sides.\n* Offers broad, productive or creative solutions to issues.\n* Confidentiality, as the details of mediation and the resulting agreements reached are not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely.\n* Following a mediation outcome, it is open to the parties to the mediation to take further steps between them. This can include entering into a legally binding agreement that incorporates some or all of the outcomes from the mediation, provided the parties clearly intend and agree to it.\n* Other enforcement processes often expect you to have negotiated in good faith before escalating (for example, a court is likely to require mediation be attempted before hearing a case)."

      "text": "Before you engage in mediation, you should think about whether mediation is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and what kind of mediator would suit your needs best. \n\n**How do I choose the right mediator?** \n\nIt can be helpful to consider these questions when selecting a mediator to help ensure they are right for you:   \n\n1. Would the parties like the mediator to provide a neutral evaluation of their dispute, or act as a facilitator of their negotiations?\n2. What are the desirable professional qualifications and specialist experience of the mediator?\n3. Is it more important for the mediator to have experience in the subject matter of the dispute, or the process of mediation itself?\n4. Is more than one mediator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a mediation specialist as co-mediators?\n5. Does a conflict of interest exist?\n\nThere is a wide range of mediation providers, ranging from government and public-funded bodies to private practitioners. Here's a list of directories and mediation providers that may assist you in finding a mediator you would like to engage:  \n\n* [The Resolution Institute's Dispute Resolver Directory list](https://resolution.institute/Web/Shared_Content/Profiles/Member-Directory/Member-Directory.aspx)\n* [The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO)](https://www.asbfeo.gov.au/)  provides small business and family enterprises with information about dispute resolution options, access to mediation and alternative dispute resolution processes.\n* [The World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiMzbCTouqKAxVCSmwGHaVGNcEQFnoECBcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wipo.int%2Famc%2Fen%2F&usg=AOvVaw2qsEjFbq-uX_WuIOR5puTG&opi=89978449)  offers mediation, arbitration and expert determination to enable private parties to settle their international commercial disputes.

This can include entering into a legally binding agreement that incorporates some or all of the outcomes from the mediation, provided the parties clearly intend and agree to it.\n* Other enforcement processes often expect you to have negotiated in good faith before escalating (for example, a court is likely to require mediation be attempted before hearing a case)."

            "text": "Before you engage in mediation, you should think about whether mediation is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and what kind of mediator would suit your needs best. \n\nHow do I choose the right mediator? \n\nIt can be helpful to consider these questions when selecting a mediator to help ensure they are right for you:   \n\n1. Would the parties like the mediator to provide a neutral evaluation of their dispute, or act as a facilitator of their negotiations?\n2. What are the desirable professional qualifications and specialist experience of the mediator?\n3. Is it more important for the mediator to have experience in the subject matter of the dispute, or the process of mediation itself?\n4. Is more than one mediator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a mediation specialist as co-mediators?\n5. Does a conflict of interest exist?\n\nThere is a wide range of mediation providers, ranging from government and public-funded bodies to private practitioners. Here's a list of directories and mediation providers that may assist you in finding a mediator you would like to engage:  \n\n The Resolution Institute's Dispute Resolver Directory list\n The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO)  provides small business and family enterprises with information about dispute resolution options, access to mediation and alternative dispute resolution processes.\n The World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center  offers mediation, arbitration and expert determination to enable private parties to settle their international commercial disputes. For more information, see WIPO ADR Options.\n the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration\n the Mediator Standards Board\n the Australian Disputes Centre\n\nThe Small Business Commissions in most states and territories can also assist with resolving business related disputes. They offer a variety of services to assist small business including low-cost mediation services.  \n\n Victorian Small Business Commission\n New South Wales Small Business Commissioner\n South Australian Small Business Commissioner\n Western Australia Small Business Development Corporation\n Queensland Small Business Commissioner\n\nFor some types of disputes related to copyright or licensing, there may be specialist dispute resolution services available. For example:\n\n the Arts Law Centre of Australia has access to a panel of mediators and experts who can provide low-cost ADR services to artists and arts organisations who subscribe to Arts Law.\n Resolution Pathways is a service available to music creators and music users disputing their interactions with~~,~~ APRA AMCOS and/or OneMusic Australia, as well as, in limited circumstances, disputes between music creators.\n\nYou can also seek help from IP professionals to obtain advice on whether ADR would be suitable for your situation and represent you throughout an ADR process. You can find a qualified IP attorney to assist you at: Find an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board."
