If your situation is not covered in the Dispute Support Tool, then you can contact the Ombudsman directly on 1300 650 460 and receive assistance from one of their case management officers. \n\nASBFEO can guide you through dispute resolution by: \n\n* Providing information to resolve your dispute in a timely and low-cost way\n* Engaging with the parties to encourage resolution\n* When appropriate, arranging various Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) solutions such as mediation, arbitration and case appraisal.",

Resolution of cases through engagement and alternative dispute resolution is around 80% — in whole or part through these methods. In a specific dispute, the likelihood of resolution may depend on a wide range of factors such as: * The goodwill between the parties * Whether the parties would benefit from continuing their relationship * The potential to bring a legal action should informal methods fail * The freedom and ability to negotiate an outcome."
