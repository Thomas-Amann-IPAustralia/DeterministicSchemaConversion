      "description": "Free IP tools are no-cost online services that let you look up, track and learn about intellectual property (IP) rights. They cover everything from quick trade mark checks to deep patent searches and step-by-step help guides.\n\nUsing these tools may boost your confidence before spending money on paid databases or engaging professional help. They can help you spot obvious conflicts, confirm renewal dates or see if someone is already using a similar brand.\n\nMost tools work through online forms. Users can enter keywords, images or classification codes and receive instant results drawn from official registers such as Australian trade mark, patent, design and plant breeder\u2019s rights databases, or global collections like the Global Brand Database.\n\nMany also include learning modules, alerts or visual maps so users can keep an eye on possible competitors. Some providers (e.g. PATENTSCOPE) offer free accounts for saving searches and setting up email notifications.\n\nThese services focus on publicly available data. Results are often limited to the scope of their own databases (e.g. IP Australia registers will only have data relating to applications submitted to IP Australia), and can be hard to interpret. If you are worried about copying, it\u2019s important to remember that only a court can confirm that infringement has occurred. It\u2019s also important to make sure that your confidential details are never be entered into public search tools.\n\nHere are some common tools and what they can help with:\n\n* **TM Checker \u2013 IP Australia**: Quickly checks if your business name or logo is similar to any registered Australian trade marks.\n* **Australian Trade Mark Search \u2013 IP Australia**: Searches the full trade mark register for registered and pending marks, including word and image marks.\n* **Australian Patent Search \u2013 IP Australia**: Lets you search Australian patent applications and granted patents.\n* **Australian Design Search \u2013 IP Australia**: Helps you check if a design similar to yours has already been registered.\n* **Australian Plant Breeder\u2019s Rights Search \u2013 IP Australia**: Lets you find out if a plant variety is protected in Australia.\n* **IP First Response \u2013 IP Australia**: Helps you explore what to do next if you suspect someone is using your IP.\n* **Find an IP attorney or firm \u2013 Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board:** Helps you find and contact a qualified IP attorney.\n* **Global Brand Database \u2013 WIPO**: Searches trade marks registered in many countries at once.\n* **PATENTSCOPE \u2013 WIPO**: Lets you search international patent applications and many national patent collections.\n* **The Lens**: Combines global patent data with scientific research and innovation landscapes.",
