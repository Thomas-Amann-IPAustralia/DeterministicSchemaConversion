            "text": "Where a PBR is registered with IP Australia, the following activities may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without permission of the owner:\n1. Someone uses the plant variety\nAustralian plant variety law gives plant breeders exclusive control over their varieties.\n\n7\n\n Infringement occurs when a person uses a protected plant variety in ways that only the owner is allowed to do so and without permission.\n\n8\n\n They could be using the plant variety in different ways, including:\n\n* Producing or reproducing the plant material.This happens when someone creates more plants of the protected variety. Reproduction here is the act of making more plants by growing seeds or using cuttings.9\n\n* Conditioning the plant material for propagation.This happens when someone prepares the plant materials for growing more plants.10For example, cleaning, coating, sorting, packaging, or grading materials such as seeds, stems, and branches.\n\n* Commercialising of propagating material.Including selling (or offering to sell) plants or their reproductive materials, bringing protected plant materials into Australia or sending them overseas or keeping plant materials for any of these commercial purposes.11\n2. Someone uses the plant variety name\nInfringement can also occur where the protected plant variety name is used on \n\nother plants or varieties\n\n.\n\n12\n\n Protection can extend to include a synonym of the plant variety name registered with IP Australia.\n\n13\n\nFor example,\n\n if a plant breeder registers a new rose variety with the name 'SUNSPARK' with the synonym 'SPARK', another grower developing and selling a rose called 'SPARK' would be an infringement.\n\n3. Someone uses an\n\nessentially derived variety\nPBR protection also covers plant varieties that are very similar to the protected ones.\n\n14\n\n Therefore, infringement can occur when someone uses another variety that is considered too similar. Owners of PBRs\n\n can also seek to have varieties called an essentially derived variety (EDV).\n\n15\n\n These varieties share all the essential characteristics of a registered plant variety but are distinguishable from one another. See information on PBR \n\n'Additional rights available'\n\n.\n\n4. Someone uses harvested material\nInfringement can also occur \n\nif someone grows a protected plant variety without permission and harvests material from those plants \n\n(such as fruit or flowers).\n\n16\n\n This can also include products \n\nmade from material harvested from the protected variety (such as fruit juice).\n\n17"

            "text": "The \n\nPlant Breeders' Act 1994\n\nrecognises that someone might unknowingly infringe a PBR. For instance, using a protected plant material without realising it was protected. Where a court finds infringement has occurred, it may refuse to award damages or to make an order for account of profits against an \"innocent\" infringer.\n\n22\n\n For a person to be \"innocent\", they must satisfy the court that at the time of infringement, they were not aware that the plant material was protected.\n\n23\n\nHowever, if the plant variety has been appropriately labelled to indicate its protection, the law assumes that the person should have been aware of its protection under a PBR.\n\n24\nThis makes proper labelling crucial for owners. It not only informs people about existing rights but also prevents infringers from later claiming they were unaware of the protection.
