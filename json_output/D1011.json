This helps you make an informed choice about waiting and know what tools are available if you change your mind later.\n Develop a clear strategy for when you will take future enforcement action. Your plan can outline specific triggers that will prompt you to act. These might be when the infringer:\n  + Grows beyond a certain size.\n  + Starts competing in your geographic area or digital space.\n  + Has been infringing for a set period.\n  + Crosses other meaningful boundaries for your business.\n Calculate the potential costs and timeline for different enforcement actions. This helps you budget and prepare for if you do decide to move forward.\n Identify which type of IP professional you would consult if you choose to act. Consider having initial conversations to understand their services and approach.\n* Keep documentation of the infringement, including dates and evidence, to maintain a strong foundation if you choose to take action in the future."
