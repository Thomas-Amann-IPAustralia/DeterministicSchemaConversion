It can help cover the legal costs and potential damages involved in defending against infringement allegations or enforcing one's own IP rights. IP insurance can apply to various forms of registered intellectual property, such as patents and trademarks, or unregistered rights like copyrights and trade secrets. There are also other forms of insurance that may be relevant, such as litigation insurance.",

Additionally, insurers typically **do not cover disputes or infringements that are already known, in progress or on the horizon.**\n* **Insurer control over litigation strategy:** When a claim arises, the insurance company may want to settle quickly to minimise costs, even if you would prefer to continue to fight the claim. In some cases, this can lead to a conflict between the insurer's cost-control objectives and your business goals. Additionally, some policies will require you to use the insurer's panel of approved attorneys - which may make it difficult or more costly to use your own preferred IP counsel (if you already have one in mind)."
