            "text": "When considering patent infringement, it is essential to understand what a granted patent protects. A patent protects any device, substance, method or process that's new, inventive and useful.1 A granted patent provides its owner with exclusive control over the invention. A patent protects the specific invention described and claimed in the patent document. This can include the particular way something is made, how it works or the specific process for doing something.\n\n**For example,** the Cochlear implant (a device) and polymer (plastic) bank notes (a substance) are inventions that have been protected with granted patents.\n\nThe most important part of a patent document is the statement of claims, which defines exactly what the inventor is legally protecting. A patent may contain multiple claims, each of which must be directed towards the same invention. Patent claims are written clearly and concisely to define what the invention is and what it is not. Therefore, the claims set out the boundaries of what others are not allowed to copy without the owner's permission. For infringement to take place, a person must do or produce something that is specified in one or more of the patent claims.\n\nWhen someone receives a granted patent in Australia, they are given legal rights to their invention for a specified period. These rights include the right to stop others from using their invention without permission."

            "text": "Where a patent is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:\n\n**1. Someone uses the patented invention**\n\nAustralian patent law gives inventors exclusive control over their patented inventions. Infringement occurs when a person uses a patented invention in a manner that only the owner is allowed to do so without permission.2 It can happen in two ways:\n\n**When someone directly uses the patented invention.**Use happens when someone:\n\n* Makes or manufactures a product that uses the patented invention\n* Uses the patented method or process\n* Sells, offers to sell, or brings into Australia a product that uses the patented invention\n* Uses a product that was made using the patented process.\n\n**When someone helps another to infringe the patent.**This happens when someone supplies products to another person, knowing they will use those products to infringe a patent.3\n\n**2. Someone uses an invention covered by the patent**\n\nInfringement occurs when someone does something or produces something that includes\u00a0all the features mentioned in one or more of the claims in the patent.\u00a0To work out whether patent infringement has occurred, courts look at:\n\n1. **What exactly is protected**? They first look at the \"claims\" section of the patent. Claims are typically located at the end of a patent document and contain numbered statements that describe precisely which parts of the invention are protected.\n2. **Compare with the suspected product or process**. Courts examine whether the product or process includes all the essential elements described in at least one of the patent claims.\n3. **Consider variations**. Even if a product is not exactly the same as what is described in the patent, it may still infringe.4 For example, if someone\u00a0substitutes an inessential part with another, that is equivalent."
