You can use this letter to communicate your concerns and demands. It\u2019s often one of the first actions taken if you are satisfied that an infringement is occurring.\u00a0\n\nAn effective letter of demand will:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* Identify your ownership of the IP right (or the other basis on which you can make a claim if you do not own the right yourself \u2013 for example, if you have an exclusive licence) and whether you are entitled to make requests to cease infringement.\n* Document the infringing conduct, with written examples, if possible.\n* Specify the legislation under which your IP is being protected.\n* Clearly specify your demands \u2013 for example, that the party stop infringing your IP rights, return or destroy all infringing property, pay you compensation, or obtain a licence from you.\n* Give a specific timeframe for the infringer to stop infringing, return all infringing property to you, or pay the requested sum.\n* State that if the demands aren't met, you may take further actions to stop the infringing behaviour.\n\n**Before sending a letter of demand, you will need to be satisfied that the other party\u2019s actions amount to infringement and it is recommended that you speak to an IP lawyer or an IP attorney.\u202fThere can be serious consequences if you send a letter of demand with no basis including a risk that the party you sent the letter of demand to may sue you. IP laws include \u2018unjustified threat\u2019 provisions (also referred to as \u2018groundless threats\u2019 in copyright law) under which you might be liable to pay damages/compensation or you may be ordered to stop making the threat.**\n\n**For more information about what constitutes an infringement, see our information on**[**what infringement can look like**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/infringement-101 \"Infringement 101 \")**.****An IP professional can help you make this assessment and draft the letter.**\n\n**Please note that sending a letter of demand before consulting with an IP professional may result in detrimental outcomes for you and your IP right. Please consider carefully if you want to undertake this action and are fully aware of the risks involved.**\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**A letter of demand will also usually be more effective if it is sent by an IP lawyer or IP\u202fattorney on your behalf, rather than you sending it personally. However, you may want to consider the cost of obtaining this legal assistance against the monetary value of any compensation or licence fee you are seeking.**",
