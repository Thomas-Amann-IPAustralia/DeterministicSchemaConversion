You can use this letter to communicate your concerns and demands. It\u2019s often one of the first actions taken if you are satisfied that an infringement is occurring.\u00a0\n\nAn effective letter of demand will:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* Identify your ownership of the IP right (or the other basis on which you can make a claim if you do not own the right yourself \u2013 for example, if you have an exclusive licence) and whether you are entitled to make requests to cease infringement.\n* Document the infringing conduct, with written examples, if possible.\n* Specify the legislation under which your IP is being protected.\n* Clearly specify your demands \u2013 for example, that the party stop infringing your IP rights, return or destroy all infringing property, pay you compensation, or obtain a licence from you.\n* Give a specific timeframe for the infringer to stop infringing, return all infringing property to you, or pay the requested sum.\n* State that if the demands aren't met, you may take further actions to stop the infringing behaviour.\n\n**Before sending a letter of demand, you will need to be satisfied that the other party\u2019s actions amount to infringement and it is recommended that you speak to an IP lawyer or an IP attorney.\u202fThere can be serious consequences if you send a letter of demand with no basis including a risk that the party you sent the letter of demand to may sue you. IP laws include \u2018unjustified threat\u2019 provisions (also referred to as \u2018groundless threats\u2019 in copyright law) under which you might be liable to pay damages/compensation or you may be ordered to stop making the threat.**\n\n**For more information about what constitutes an infringement, see our information on**[**what infringement can look like**](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/infringement-101 \"Infringement 101 \")**.****An IP professional can help you make this assessment and draft the letter.**\n\n**Please note that sending a letter of demand before consulting with an IP professional may result in detrimental outcomes for you and your IP right. Please consider carefully if you want to undertake this action and are fully aware of the risks involved.**\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**A letter of demand will also usually be more effective if it is sent by an IP lawyer or IP\u202fattorney on your behalf, rather than you sending it personally. However, you may want to consider the cost of obtaining this legal assistance against the monetary value of any compensation or licence fee you are seeking.**",

This could potentially jeopardise your own IP rights. * For trade marks, it might also prompt the other party to apply for their own trade mark, which may then need to be opposed. * Sending a letter of demand might give the suspected infringer time to hide or destroy evidence.

Fees for IP professionals vary depending on the complexity of the issues at hand and which type of IP professional you engage. Fees to draft a letter of demand generally sit between:\u00a0  * For trade marks: $1,500 to $5,000 * For patents: $1,500 to $10,000  However, you should keep in mind that before drafting a letter of demand, it would be necessary to review relevant materials to confirm whether there is a proper basis for sending the letter of demand, because sending an unjustified threat could expose you to legal action. This means that the fees will also depend on how much work may be required to establish your IP rights and to confirm that there is a proper basis for your suspicion that your IP rights are being infringed by the other party.\u00a0\u00a0  Some copyright owners could explore avenues for accessing low- or no-cost legal advice. For example:\u00a0  * the Arts Law Centre of Australia (a not-for-profit independent national community legal centre for the arts) can provide advice to artists and arts organisations on queries related to their arts practice, including in relation to copyright ([www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/](http://www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/) ). Arts Law also offers a\u00a0[template letter of demand](https://www.artslaw.com.au/product/copyright-infringement-letter-of-demand/)  for copyright infringement, which is free for subscribers and low cost (around $30) for non-subscribers. Arts Law can also provide advice on draft letters that use their template, or otherwise provide a referral to other lawyers who can assist in drafting a letter (though lawyer fees would apply). * The Australian Copyright Council (an independent, not-for-profit Community Legal Service (CLS) whose affiliate members include the peak bodies for Australian writers, musicians, designers, photographers, visual artists, journalists, film makers and architects) offers eligible persons (predominantly those working in the creative industries) free written advice ([www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/](http://www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/) )."
