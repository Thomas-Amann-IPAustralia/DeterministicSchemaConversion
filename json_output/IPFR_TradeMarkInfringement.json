            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "<p>Where a trade mark is registered with IP Australia, the following combined events may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without the permission of the owner:</p><p><strong>1. Someone </strong><strong>uses</strong><strong> a sign \"as a trade mark\"</strong></p><p>This is a crucial requirement. The infringer must use the sign as a 'badge of origin,'<sup>12</sup> or in other words, to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services.<sup>13</sup> This involves using the trade mark to identify or differentiate their products or services in the marketplace.<sup>14</sup> This requirement limits infringement and allows for legitimate references to trade marks in contexts that do not suggest commercial origin.</p><p><strong>Examples of use as a trade </strong><strong>mark</strong><strong>:</strong></p><ul><li>Applying the sign to product packaging or labels<sup>15</sup></li><li>Using the sign in advertising to promote goods or services<sup>16</sup></li><li>Displaying the sign on business signage or storefronts<sup>17</sup></li><li>Using the sign on websites to market products<sup>18</sup></li></ul><p><strong>Examples that are not use as a </strong><strong>trade</strong><strong> mark:</strong></p><ul><li>Using a word in its ordinary descriptive sense (e.g., using \"apple\" to refer to the fruit)<sup>19</sup></li><li>Referring to a trade mark for informational purposes<sup>20</sup></li><li>Using a sign purely for functional or decorative purposes<sup>21</sup></li></ul><p>2. Someone uses an almost identical trade mark or one that is similar enough to confuse people</p><p>This is when someone uses a trade mark that resembles or sounds almost exactly like a registered trade mark,<sup>22</sup> with only tiny differences that would go unnoticed by most consumers.</p><p><strong>For example,</strong> suppose the word \"KOALA COMFORTS\" is a registered trade mark for bedding products. In that case, using \"KOALA KOMFORTS\" (just changing the spelling) for similar products would likely be considered too similar. Alternatively, someone uses a trade mark that, despite having some differences, is too similar to the registered trade mark. This similarity is likely to confuse consumers about who produces the product or provides the services.<sup>23</sup> For instance, it may look or sound similar enough to a registered trade mark. </p><p><strong>For example,</strong> if \"BLUE WAVE\" with a wave picture is a registered trade mark for surfboards (see below), using \"BLU WAIVES\" with a similar wave design for surf gear could confuse customers into thinking they are from the same company.</p><p>When looking at possible trade mark infringement, courts compare the registered trade mark with the alleged infringing trade mark and consider:</p><ul><li>How similar the trade marks look and sound<sup>24</sup></li><li>The impression left by the trade marks<sup>25</sup></li><li>Whether the trade marks convey the same idea<sup>26</sup></li><li>Where and how the products are sold<sup>27</sup></li><li>Whether the typical customer would take the time to notice differences<sup>28</sup></li><li>Whether anyone has actually been confused.<sup>29</sup></li></ul><p><strong>3. Using the mark on the same or similar goods </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> services</strong></p><p>Lastly, the trade mark is used to sell goods or services that are the same or similar to those listed in the registered trade mark. Therefore, infringement can still occur even when the trade mark is used for goods or services that are not identical to those covered by a registered trade mark but are similar or closely related.<sup>30</sup></p><p><strong>For example,</strong> if \"SUNNY DAYS\" is registered for coffee, using \"SUNNY DAYS\" for soft drinks might infringe because both products are related to non-alcoholic beverages.<sup>31</sup> Customers might think the same company makes them.</p><p>Again, courts consider several factors when determining whether goods or services are similar or closely related.<sup>32</sup></p><p>Alternatively, infringement can occur when someone uses a 'well known' trade mark in relation to goods or services unrelated to those listed in the registration.<sup>33</sup> However, this kind of infringement has not been heard much in court, and its scope is not currently clear. </p>"
