Getting an IP professional to draft the licence can help to reduce this risk.\n* You may need to monitor the licence agreement to ensure the other party complies with it.\n* Licensing your IP rights to others has the potential to reduce the uniqueness or value of your IP depending on the circumstances, including who you license it to and the licensing terms.\n* If you *exclusively* license your IP rights, you will no longer be able to use them yourself.\n* In specific instances regarding trade marks, if the licensor is unable to maintain effective controls over trade mark use, the trade mark can become vulnerable to removal for non-use.\n* In the case a patent has been licensed to an exclusive licensee \u2013 they will have the right to commence infringement proceedings. In some cases, the patent holder can also be added as a party to those proceedings, potentially leading to legal action or expense.\n* If you do not put in place arrangements to protect your sensitive commercial information (such as specific business practices or product features) during negotiations, it may be shared with other parties or misused by the recipient.\n* You may also need to consider the potential tax implications of the licence, particularly if you are operating in multiple jurisdictions."
