If you've got a logo, there's a chance you've come across us, a government agency called \n\n**IP Australia.**\nBut how are we different from all the other government services out there?\n**Agency**\n\n \n\n**Main Focus**\n\n \n\n**How It Helps You**\n\n \n\n**IP Australia**\n\n \n\nIntellectual property rights that can be registered (patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeders' rights)\n\n \n\nHelps you protect many of the things that make your business unique.\n\n \n\n**ATO (Australian Tax Office)**\n\n \n\nTax & Super\n\n \n\nHelps with tax returns, superannuation, and small business deductions.\n\n \n\n**ASBFEO (Small Business Ombudsman)**\n\n \n\nAdvocacy & Disputes\n\n \n\nHelps if you're in a dispute with another business or the government.\n\n \n\n**Austrade**\n\n \n\nExporting\n\n \n\nSupports businesses trying to sell overseas.\n\n \n\n**AusIndustry**\n\n \n\nInnovation & Funding\n\n \n\nGives advice and support to help you grow and innovate.\n\n \n\n**Fair Work Ombudsman**\n\n \n\nHiring Staff\n\n \n\nHelps you follow the rules when employing people.\n\n \n\n**Business.gov.au**\n\n \n\nAll-round help\n\n \n\nConnects you to programs, grants, and advice across all departments.\n\n \n\n**Services Australia**\n\n \n\nBenefits & Reporting\n\n \n\nOffers tools for things like paid parental leave and employer reporting.\n\n \n\n**ABF (Border Force)**\n\n \n\nImports/Exports\n\n \n\nHelps with customs and border rules.\n\n \n\n**ASIC**\n\n \n\nBusiness Names & Companies\n\n \n\nHelps you register and manage your business name or company.\n\n \n\n**Safe Work Australia**\n\n \n\nWorkplace Safety\n\n \n\nGives advice and templates to keep workers safe.\n**Protect your uniqueness**\nYour name, logo, invention, or product design can be \n\n*some of your most valuable assets*\n\n. But they don't automatically get legal protection - you often need to \n\n**register**\n\n them. While some forms of IP rights are automatically created (e.g. copyright), many other forms of IP rights require registration for legal protection and enforcement.\nWe make it easier to:\n* **Own your brand**(by holding it as an intellectual property and a legal basis to enforce your right to the IP)\n\n* **Stop copycats**(by minimising confusion between your product, brand, ideas and those of others)\n\n* **Get funding or partners**(because your IP proves you have something valuable)\n**Use the right service at the right time**\nYou don't have to know everything all at once. But knowing that \n\n**IP Australia**\n\n helps you protect your ideas - and that other agencies support your growth, staff, taxes, exports and more - is a great starting point."
