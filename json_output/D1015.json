You can do this by filing the Notice of intention to defend through IP Australia's Manage my IP  page. If you choose not to file the Notice of intention to defend, your removal application will be taken as successfully opposed, and the trade mark will stay on the Register.  \n\nHowever, if you choose to defend your removal application, more time will be taken by IP Australia to reach a final decision as it will need to allocate time for the parties to file evidence and submissions."
