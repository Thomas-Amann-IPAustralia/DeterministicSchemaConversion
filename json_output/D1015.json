If you wish to respond to the opposition and establish that there is a case for removal based on non-use, this will lengthen the removal process and take up further cost, time and efforts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA party who is dissatisfied with IP Australia's decision can also appeal it to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court of Australia, which could be highly time-consuming and costly.\u00a0\n\n**Exposure resulting from notification and publication**\u00a0\n\nThe owner and their representative of the trade mark which is subject to a removal procedure will be notified of your application to remove the trade mark. This notification happens within one month of filing the application. A copy of the application will be forwarded with the notification, which will include your details and the details of your filing.\u00a0\n\nIP Australia also must give notice of the application for removal by publishing it on the Australian Trade Marks Search ('the Register'). This means that other parties would be aware of your identity and also your attempt to remove the trade mark from the Register. This may trigger the other party to oppose your application or initiate other forms of action (i.e. administrative hearings, court proceedings, etc.) against you and/or your business."

You can do this by filing the ***Notice of intention to defend*** through IP Australia's [Manage my IP](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/manage-my-ip)  page.
