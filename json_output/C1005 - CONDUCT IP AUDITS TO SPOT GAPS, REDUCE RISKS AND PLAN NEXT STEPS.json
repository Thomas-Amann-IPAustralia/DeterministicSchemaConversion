            "text": "An intellectual property (IP) audit is a review of the intellectual property you or your business owns, uses or has acquired. It aims to identify what IP exists in your portfolio, who owns it, what it\u2019s worth, its legal status, and what to do next. An IP audit is often the very first step in designing and setting up a [comprehensive IP strategy](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/develop-strategy-manage-your-ip).\n\nAudits can be done in-house or with help from IP professionals such as IP lawyers or a qualified patent or trade mark attorney. They offer a clear picture of whether your IP assets are protected and aligned with your business goals.\n\nCommon triggers for an IP audit include:\n\n* Significant corporate change, such as a merger or acquisition\n* Entering a joint venture or strategic alliance\n* Transfer or assignment of IP rights\n* Launch of a new product line or market expansion\n* Initiation of enforcement or defence actions.\n\nHowever, many businesses also conduct regular audits to systematically review their IP portfolio to evaluate their IP assets, renew their IP rights and minimise risks."
