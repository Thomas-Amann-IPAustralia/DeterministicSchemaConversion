For more information about what ADR is, see IP First Response's webpage available at: [General ADR Card](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ADR).\n\nThe WIPO Center's tools and services include:\n\n* Free information and procedural assistance services (sometimes called '[Good Offices](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/goodoffices/) ') to facilitate or submit a dispute to WIPO's ADR processes. This includes providing support throughout the parties' engagement with the ADR options.\n* An [extensive global database](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/neutrals/index.html)  of mediators, arbitrators and experts, including from Australia. This includes experts from specific fields/specialties: [WIPO Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Services for Specific Sectors](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/center/specific-sectors/).\n* Free [online case administration tools](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/eadr/) that allow parties to manage and resolve disputes remotely.\n\nADR processes offered by the WIPO Centre include: \n\n* [Mediation](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/mediation/index.html)\n* [Arbitration](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/)\n* [Expedited Arbitration](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/what-is-exp-arb.html)\n* [Expert determination](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/expert-determination/)\n\nYour dispute doesn't need to be international to use the WIPO Center, and other international dispute resolution services are available in some countries.

      "text": "While this varies depending on the ADR process used, ADR generally offers the following benefits over dispute resolution through the court system:\n\n* Costs are lower than court proceedings - particularly in the case of complex international disputes.\n* Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.\n* Offers broader and more creative resolution solutions.\n* Confidentiality, as decisions and records are not shared with the public.\n* Less confrontational, helping both parties keep things from getting heated and can help preserve business relationships.\n* If a dispute spans across multiple countries, a single ADR procedure can potentially resolve all the issues in one forum, saving time, reducing costs, and minimising the risk of inconsistent outcomes. Can have binding and enforceable outcomes in the form of a settlement contract or arbitral award.\n* Arbitral decisions are final and cannot be appealed, unlike court rulings, while mediated settlements typically align with both parties' interests, preventing the likelihood of further dispute.\n* Globally enforceable, whereas a court decision is typically confined to the jurisdiction of the country where the court is located. Using the WIPO Center's services has the additional benefits of:\n  + Procedural assistance so the process is easy to navigate and use.\n  + Simplifying international disputes that involve multiple jurisdictions and languages."

            "text": "While this varies depending on the ADR process used, ADR generally offers the following benefits over dispute resolution through the court system:\n\n Costs are lower than court proceedings - particularly in the case of complex international disputes.\n Flexible and informal, as parties have control over shaping the process.\n Offers broader and more creative resolution solutions.\n Confidentiality, as decisions and records are not shared with the public.\n Less confrontational, helping both parties keep things from getting heated and can help preserve business relationships.\n If a dispute spans across multiple countries, a single ADR procedure can potentially resolve all the issues in one forum, saving time, reducing costs, and minimising the risk of inconsistent outcomes. Can have binding and enforceable outcomes in the form of a settlement contract or arbitral award.\n Arbitral decisions are final and cannot be appealed, unlike court rulings, while mediated settlements typically align with both parties' interests, preventing the likelihood of further dispute.\n Globally enforceable, whereas a court decision is typically confined to the jurisdiction of the country where the court is located. Using the WIPO Center's services has the additional benefits of:\n  + Procedural assistance so the process is easy to navigate and use.\n  + Simplifying international disputes that involve multiple jurisdictions and languages."
