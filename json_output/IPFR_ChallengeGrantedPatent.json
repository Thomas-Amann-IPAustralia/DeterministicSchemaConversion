This can be a cheaper, faster alternative than going to court.\u00a0\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be in a formal dispute with a patent holder to use this option. Anyone (with a reasonable justification) can request a patent re-examination at any time after it has been granted.\u00a0\n\nThe request must explain why the patent may be invalid and refer to relevant evidence, such as published documents that show the invention was already known. IP Australia will re-examine the patent and, decide whether to revoke or amend it.\u00a0\n\nIf the patent hasn\u2019t been granted yet, it may be possible to challenge it through IP Australia\u2019s opposition and hearing process instead ([Challenge a new or amended patent | IP Australia First Response)](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/challenge-new-or-amended-patent).\u00a0\n\nIn the case you wish to dispute the ownership of the patent, it may also be able to challenge the ownership of the patent through IP Australia\u2019s opposition and hearing process.",
