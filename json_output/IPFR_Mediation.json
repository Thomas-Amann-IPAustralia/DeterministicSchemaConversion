      "description": "Mediation is a widely used type of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process where a neutral third party, called a mediator, helps parties negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement.\u202fMediation is a flexible, straightforward and often very efficient method to resolving IP disputes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMediation can be used at any stage during a dispute process. It can be a preventative method used prior to an actual dispute, where parties may have encountered a roadblock. It can also be used in early stages of disputes, when parties fail to reach a resolution on their own. Lastly, you may even engage in mediation during more formal dispute resolution processes (that is, litigation or arbitration).\u202f\u00a0\n\nWhile mediation can be ordered by court, it is often a voluntary process whereby disputing parties agree to negotiate an outcome with help from a mediator. Parties can discuss the suitability of mediation as a method to resolve their IP dispute and agree to participate in the process via different ways, including communicating directly through telephone discussions, email correspondence or instructing their legal representatives to do so.\u00a0\n\nMediation is an attractive option for parties who:\u202f\u00a0\n\n* place a premium on the preservation or enhancement of their relationship, for instance when parties have an existing contractual or business relationship\n* seek to maintain control over the dispute settlement process, with some flexibility to shape the mediation procedures without procedural rules being imposed by others\n* value confidentiality, or\n\nwant to reach a speedy settlement without damage to their reputations.\u202f\u00a0\n\n**When is mediation not appropriate?**\u00a0\n\nMediation isn\u2019t for everyone. Mediation may not be suitable when:\u202f\u00a0\n\n* one or both parties need an impartial opinion on a matter of difference, perhaps to set a precedent or to be vindicated publicly on an issue in dispute\n* a party is certain that it has a straightforward case to the extent that there is no room for settlement or negotiation\n* deliberate counterfeiting or piracy has occurred.",
