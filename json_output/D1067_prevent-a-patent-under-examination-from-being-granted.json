Formal opposition becomes available after the patent is accepted, and court or administrative action may be possible after the grant of the patent. \n\nYou can raise the same kinds of concerns about a patent at different points in its life - but the mechanism you use depends on the patent's current status. \n\nRaising concerns during examination can be quicker, simpler and less costly. It gives the examiner a chance to consider your evidence before a decision is made. If successful, this could prevent a patent from being granted at all--avoiding future disputes. \n\nYou don't need to own a patent or be directly affected to file a notice. Anyone can use this option if they have access to useful prior art and act within the time window. \n\nThis is a one-way process: the examiner considers your materials, but you won't be told the outcome, and you can't argue your case. There are still other channels in which you can pursue the matter if the patent is accepted despite the S27 submissions. \n\nIt is also important to consider that the document(s) raised under the s27(1) notice were published prior to the relevant priority date of the patent application.",
