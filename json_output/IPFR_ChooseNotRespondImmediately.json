This can be even more confusing if the allegation that you are infringing someone\u2019s intellectual property (IP) appears weak or unfounded. It is a good idea to evaluate the situation and consider your options before deciding how you might deal with the infringement allegation.\n\n**Not taking an immediate action does not mean that you should ignore the issue. You may require some time to:**\n\n* Assess the other party\u2019s claims and demands relating to the alleged infringement.\n* Verify their identity and the validity of the rights they claim ownership of.\n* Consider any evidence you may have to refute their claims.\n* Consult with legal professionals, or to decide on your next steps.\n* Determine whether the letter is genuine or is fraudulent.\n\nFor more information on how to assess a letter of demand (or a cease-and-desist letter), see IP First Response\u2019s page on\u00a0[Receiving a letter of demand](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/receiving-letter-demand).",
