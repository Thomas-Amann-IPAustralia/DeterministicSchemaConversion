As such, it might be risky to base your entire enforcement strategy on this procedure expecting IP Australia to make a revocation decision, instead of using other enforcement mechanisms such as challenging the trade mark registration through the court system.\n* While IP Australia does not publish the details of the party who requested revocation, it is possible for documents to be obtained under Freedom of Information Act 1982 so the owner of the trade mark can ascertain the identity of the party who requested revocation.\n* This procedure provides a much more limited opportunity to participate in the decision-making process, when compared to challenging a trade mark registration through the opposition and hearing procedures or courts.\n* Even if revocation of acceptance follows revocation of registration, the application will be returned to examination and the owner of the application will be given 15 months to overcome the grounds for rejection preventing their application from achieving acceptance.\n* In some rare cases, the application may only be reverted to acceptance stage even though the registration has been revoked, meaning that opposition process would need to be initiated to block the application proceeding to registration once more. You might need to undertake an opposition in order to prevent registration occurring again."
