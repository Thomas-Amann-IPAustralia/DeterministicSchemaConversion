      "description": "A patent re-examination is a means for challenging the *validity*\\* of a granted patent. In certain situations, such as being accused of infringement, the validity of the patent may come under heavy scrutiny. This can be requested at any time after a patent is granted by filing a request with IP Australia. Patent re-examination can be requested if you believe the patent should not have been granted for a variety of reasons, including; \n\n* The invention claimed in the patent isn't novel, innovative or inventive (this is the most common reason)\n* The invention isn't something that can be patented\n* The invention was used in public before the patent was filed\n* The patent specification doesn't provide enough detail to build or perform the invention\n* The invention isn't consistent with the description\n* The claims are so unclear that it's impossible for a skilled person to understand them\n* The invention is a biological process for generation of human beings (such as human cloning).\n\n*\\*the validity of a patent regards its compliance with the Patents Act, i.e. if it should have been granted in the first place (or has new evidence come to light that indicates it should not have been granted).*",

Note that re-examination decisions may be appealed to the Federal Court."

Notably, the re-examination process also allows the patent holder to amend their claims; in some cases, allowing them to circumvent the grounds on which the patent was challenged.\nAnother significant risk associated with re-examination, is that the process is ‘*ex parte’*, meaning that after the initial submissions to the Patent Office, the challenging party is not involved in the proceedings at all. As such, if the outcome of the re-examination is not in favour of the challenging party, they have few options to refute the outcome (although, another re-examination can be *requested*).\nRequesting a re-examination will also inform the other party of your request, potentially harming professional relationships and increasing the possibility that the other party may act more defensively or even contest your own rights."
