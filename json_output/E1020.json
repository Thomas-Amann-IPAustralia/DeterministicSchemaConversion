You will usually work with a local expert (an IP lawyer or patent attorney or trade mark attorney) who understands that office's rules.\n* International systems:\n* Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for patents gives a single international application up to 30 months (or 31 months in some countries, like Australia and New Zealand) from the first filing date ('priority date') before you need to choose specific countries to apply in ('national phases').\n* Madrid System (Madrid Protocol) for trade marks covers 131 member countries under a single application, enabling extension of your Australian trade mark abroad.\n* Hague System (Hague Agreement) for design rights allows one international design right application to be extended to 92 member countries. Note that Australia is not a contracting party to the Hague Agreement, and that Australians need to meet eligibility criteria  to use the Hague System.\n* Copyright registration -- While copyright is automatic in all Berne Convention countries, some jurisdictions (for example, the United States Copyright Office) allow or require a simple registration or recordation to strengthen enforcement.\n\nInternational protection can be costly and complex, so planning early helps you focus on the markets that matter most.
