These are often modelled on the UDRP and many countries (including Australia) allow disputes to be held at WIPO. [Domain Name Dispute Resolution Service for Country Code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs)](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/cctld)\n\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a leading provider of domain name dispute resolution services. Once you lodge a complaint, a one- or 3-person panel of independent arbitrators and legal practitioners will consider submissions from both parties and provide their decision with reasoning, in writing. There are usually no in-person hearings and the panel's decisions are put into effect by the registrar (the host of the domain name).  \n\n**Please Note:** If the infringing domain name ends in '.au' then the relevant policy is the .au Dispute Resolution Policy (auDRP) provided by auDA. \n\n[](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement?utm_content=NotSure_button_experiment_v1)"

This can get complicated when dealing with international disputes, and will probably be in the registrar's or the registrant's location.
