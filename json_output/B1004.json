If an IP lawyer needs to engage a barrister to represent you in court proceedings, this will add to the costs involved.\n\nSome IP lawyers and IP attorneys offer a free initial consultation to assess what services you need and to provide you with an estimate of costs moving forward. The Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia provides a service for free consultations. That service can be found [here](https://ipta.org.au/community/get-free-consultation/).

For instance, an IP lawyer may be highly experienced in dealing with trade marks, but not so much in patents, or vice versa. Only lawyers can conduct proceedings in a court so, if you engage an IP attorney rather than an IP lawyer, they would need to refer you to an IP lawyer if you find you need to go to court to enforce your IP rights.\n Obtaining professional advice can be costly -- see 'What might the costs be?' below."

            "text": "The total costs of engaging an IP lawyer or IP attorney will depend on factors such as their fees and other costs and the complexity of the matter.\n\nFor trade marks and patent attorneys, you can expect an average fee of:\n\n $500-1,000 per hour for a patent attorney.\n $1,000-2,000 total for a trade marks attorney  to file and register a single trade mark in one or two classes of goods and services.\n\nFees for IP lawyers vary widely depending on factors such as their level of expertise, the size of the firm they work for, and where they are based. If an IP lawyer needs to engage a barrister to represent you in court proceedings, this will add to the costs involved.\n\nSome IP lawyers and IP attorneys offer a free initial consultation to assess what services you need and to provide you with an estimate of costs moving forward. The Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia provides a service for free consultations. That service can be found here. It can be a good idea to ask for an indication of how much the entire process may cost during your first meeting. IP lawyers have a professional obligation to provide you with an upfront estimate of their fees and costs."

Consider:\n\n[](/node/208)\n\n Learning more about IP and the specific IP type at the centre of the dispute. Having some basic knowledge will help you to better understand the professional's advice and recommendations.\n Researching what the person accusing you of IP infringement is doing in the market (including where they might be based and whether they have registered any IP rights) and being ready to share the results. This will help your IP lawyer or IP attorney to provide you with advice.\n\nFinding an IP lawyer or IP attorney\n\nTo find an IP lawyer, you can search on your State or Territory's law society website:\n\n The Law Society of NSW\n Law Institute Victoria\n Queensland Law Society\n The Law Society of Western Australia\n The Law Society of South Australia\n The Law Society of Tasmania\n Law Society Northern Territory\n The Law Society of the ACT\n\nTo find a registered Australian trade marks or patent attorney, you can search the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board directory: Find an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board.\n\nTips for choosing an IP lawyer or IP attorney\n\nHere are some suggestions for choosing an IP lawyer or IP attorney for your IP:\n\n Ask for recommendations from other business owners or members of your industry association.\n Ask how much you'll be charged and how long the service will take.\n Don't assume that all IP lawyers or IP attorneys specialise in the type of IP that you have.\n Try to determine if you can establish a trusting relationship. If you don't feel comfortable sharing relevant information, it could be difficult for an adviser to work in your best interests.\n If you think you may need to go to court, speak to an IP lawyer rather than an IP attorney."
