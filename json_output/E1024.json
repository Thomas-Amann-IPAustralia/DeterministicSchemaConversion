If you've got a logo, there's a chance you've come across us, a government agency called **IP Australia.** \n\nBut how are we different from all the other government services out there? \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Agency** | **Main Focus** | **How It Helps You** |\n| **IP Australia** | Intellectual property rights that can be registered (patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeders' rights) | Helps you protect many of the things that make your business unique. |\n| **ATO (Australian Tax Office)** | Tax & Super | Helps with tax returns, superannuation, and small business deductions. |\n| **ASBFEO (Small Business Ombudsman)** | Advocacy & Disputes | Helps if you're in a dispute with another business or the government. |\n| **Austrade** | Exporting | Supports businesses trying to sell overseas. |\n| **AusIndustry** | Innovation & Funding | Gives advice and support to help you grow and innovate. |\n| **Fair Work Ombudsman** | Hiring Staff | Helps you follow the rules when employing people. |\n| **Business.gov.au** | All-round help | Connects you to programs, grants, and advice across all departments. |\n| **Services Australia** | Benefits & Reporting | Offers tools for things like paid parental leave and employer reporting. |\n| **ABF (Border Force)** | Imports/Exports | Helps with customs and border rules. |\n| **ASIC** | Business Names & Companies | Helps you register and manage your business name or company. |\n| **Safe Work Australia** | Workplace Safety | Gives advice and templates to keep workers safe. |\n\n**Protect your uniqueness** \n\nYour name, logo, invention, or product design can be *some of your most valuable assets*. But they don't automatically get legal protection -- you often need to **register** them. While some forms of IP rights are automatically created (e.g. copyright), many other forms of IP rights require registration for legal protection and enforcement.  \n\nWe make it easier to: \n\n* **Own your brand** (by holding it as an intellectual property and a legal basis to enforce your right to the IP)\n* **Stop copycats** (by minimising confusion between your product, brand, ideas and those of others)\n* **Get funding or partners** (because your IP proves you have something valuable)\n\n**Use the right service at the right time** \n\nYou don't have to know everything all at once. But knowing that **IP Australia** helps you protect your ideas -- and that other agencies support your growth, staff, taxes, exports and more -- is a great starting point."
