Going to court is usually a last resort. Court proceedings are expensive, time consuming and stressful and obtaining the outcome you seek is never guaranteed. \n\nIt is prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal action in court. You will likely also need assistance from an IP lawyer if you decide to start a legal action. \n\nPatent proceedings usually involve:  \n\n* a validity challenge intended to revoke a patent in whole or in part\n* allegations of infringement of a patent.\n\nPatent proceedings in Australia are typically started in the Federal Court of Australia.",

For example, if some of the claims in a patent are challenged, one claim might be upheld and the other claim might be revoked.\nFor infringement proceedings:\n* A court might temporarily order the alleged infringer to stop any alleged infringement until a final decision is made – see [Seek an urgent injunction](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/Interim_Injunction)\n* If you’re successful in infringement proceedings, a court might order:\n+ that you be paid damages or compensation\n+ that the other party or parties pay some or all of your legal costs\n+ the infringer not to infringe your IP rights in future.\n* If you’re unsuccessful in infringement proceedings, a court might order:\n+ that you pay some or all of the legal costs for the other party or parties.\nAgain, it is possible to have a mixed result.

Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, and which court hears your claim.\nPatent cases are typically heard by the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed *intellectual property* as the cause of action, were as follows:~~;~~\n* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months\n* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months\n* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1\nIf a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.\nWhere appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.\n**Time limits for starting legal claims**\nThere are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start. Due to the complexities, it may be helpful to  speak to an IP lawyer about time limits."
