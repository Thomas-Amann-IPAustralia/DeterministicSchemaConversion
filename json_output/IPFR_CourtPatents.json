Going to court is usually a last resort. Court proceedings are expensive, time consuming and stressful and obtaining the outcome you seek is never guaranteed.\u00a0\n\n**It is prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal action in court.** You will likely also need assistance from an IP lawyer if you decide to start a legal action.\u00a0\n\nPatent proceedings usually involve:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* a validity challenge intended to revoke a patent in whole or in part\n* allegations of infringement of a patent.\n\nPatent proceedings in Australia are typically started in the Federal Court of Australia.",
