Going to court is usually a last resort. Court proceedings are expensive, time consuming and stressful and obtaining the outcome you seek is never guaranteed. \n\nIt is prudent to seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal action in court. You will likely also need assistance from an IP lawyer if you decide to start a legal action. \n\nPatent proceedings usually involve:  \n\n* a validity challenge intended to revoke a patent in whole or in part\n* allegations of infringement of a patent.\n\nPatent proceedings in Australia are typically started in the Federal Court of Australia.",

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The possible outcomes vary depending on the type of litigation. It is possible you may reach a negotiated settlement with the other party. For revocation proceedings, a court might order that a patent be: * revoked in whole or in part * amended in whole or in part * upheld in whole or in part. It is also possible to have a mixed result. For example, if some of the claims in a patent are challenged, one claim might be upheld and the other claim might be revoked. For infringement proceedings: * A court might temporarily order the alleged infringer to stop any alleged infringement until a final decision is made – see [Seek an urgent injunction](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/Interim_Injunction) * If you’re successful in infringement proceedings, a court might order: + that you be paid damages or compensation + that the other party or parties pay some or all of your legal costs + the infringer not to infringe your IP rights in future. * If you’re unsuccessful in infringement proceedings, a court might order: + that you pay some or all of the legal costs for the other party or parties. Again, it is possible to have a mixed result. For example, a court might agree that some of the other party’s conduct infringes your patent, but that other conduct does not. Courts also have powers to make other types of orders as part of the outcome. You or the other party or parties may be able to appeal the decision."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, and which court hears your claim. Patent cases are typically heard by the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed *intellectual property* as the cause of action, were as follows:~~;~~ * 95 cases (45%) under 12 months * 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months * 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1 If a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised. Where appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing. **Time limits for starting legal claims** There are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start. Due to the complexities, it may be helpful to  speak to an IP lawyer about time limits."

You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential. **Gather all your documents**\\ Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review."
