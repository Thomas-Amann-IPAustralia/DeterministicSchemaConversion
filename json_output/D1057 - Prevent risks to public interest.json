However, in some cases it will also be applicable to other types of IP infringement."

However, under Australian law it can be a criminal offence to engage in:\n\n* trade mark counterfeiting\n* certain copyright infringements \u2014 generally involving commercial dealings or done on a commercial scale\n* plant breeder\u2019s rights infringement.\n\nThese usually become a police matter when activity is serious, for example if it poses imminent risk of public harm or is highly organised or widespread. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) focuses on taking action against organisers, major importers and wholesalers of counterfeit goods. These goods pose public safety risks and can be used to support organised crime, money laundering and cybercrime.\n\nSales of counterfeit goods can be reported to [Crime Stoppers](https://crimestoppers.com.au/). If you suspect links to serious or organised crime like the above, phone 131 444 and report the matter to your local police."
