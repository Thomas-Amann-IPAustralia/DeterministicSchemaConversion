The Australian Federal Police (AFP) focuses on taking action against organisers, major importers and wholesalers of counterfeit goods. These goods pose public safety risks and can be used to support organised crime, money laundering and cybercrime.\n\nSales of counterfeit goods can be reported to Crime Stoppers. If you suspect links to serious or organised crime like the above, phone 131 444 and report the matter to your local police."
