For design rights, the status must be listed as 'certified' (not simply registered) before they can enforce their design. \n\nReview your own use of the contested IP and consider whether this might amount to infringement. \n\nIt can be very difficult to determine whether a threat is unjustified as you will usually need to determine whether the allegations of infringement are accurate. An IP lawyer or IP attorney can help you with considering whether a threat is unjustified and how you might best respond. \n\nGather evidence \n\nKeep evidence of the threat, including: \n\n- copies of the threat and any related emails or letters\n- evidence of how the threat has affected (or might affect) your business.\n\nConsider getting help from an IP lawyer \n\nStrongly consider the value of speaking to an IP lawyer. An IP lawyer can review the evidence, provide legal advice and represent you in court if the threat cannot be resolved in some other way.  \n\nGoing to court without legal representation is not advisable and, in some cases, a court will require that you have legal representation."
