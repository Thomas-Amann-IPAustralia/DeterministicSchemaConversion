Is there an existing contractual relationship between the parties which requires them (such as through an arbitration clause) to take disputes to a specific arbitral institution?\n2. If not, is the other party likely to agree to take the dispute to an arbitrator or an arbitral institution?\n3. Does the dispute concern a highly technical matter which would benefit from having a decision-maker with a high level of expertise in the specific sector or technology?\n4. Is the subject matter of the dispute considered arbitrable in relevant jurisdictions? Though most areas of IP are considered arbitrable in many jurisdictions, questions relating to validity or registrability of intellectual property are deemed as non-arbitrable in some jurisdictions.\n5. Is there a clear benefit that can be achieved from having the matter heard under procedural and evidence rules different from those of court proceedings?\n6. Is more than one arbitrator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a legal practitioner as co-arbitrators?\n\nThere is a wide range of arbitrators and arbitral institutions, ranging from public-funded bodies to private practitioners.
