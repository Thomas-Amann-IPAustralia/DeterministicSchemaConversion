The arbitrator is often someone with a high level of expertise in the specific field of law relevant to the industry or subject matter of the dispute.  \n\nArbitration can be somewhat similar to a court or tribunal hearing, but often are a shorter and more flexible version: \n\n* Parties are typically expected to produce evidence and submissions before the arbitrator to make a decision.\n* Usually, the parties to the dispute must agree before the process that the arbitrator's decision will be binding and enforceable.\n* Arbitration is generally seen as an efficient, impartial, and enforceable process to resolve both domestic and international commercial disputes, including IP matters.\n\nArbitration may be voluntary, required under a court order, or as part of a contract - arbitration clauses are often added to contracts, stipulating that the parties resolve future disputes using this method.  \n\nArbitration requires agreement from both parties, which can be challenging to obtain after a dispute arises, especially in cases involving no prior contractual relationship. For this reason, where there are contractual negotiations, it is often advantageous for parties to consider including an arbitration clause in their initial contract."

The hourly rate of an arbitrator would differ significantly depending on the amount in dispute and which arbitration/arbitral institution the parties choose.

      "text": "Before you engage in arbitration, you should think about whether arbitration is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and which arbitration types would suit your needs best. \n\nSome questions to consider before you take your dispute to arbitration:   \n\n1. Is there an existing contractual relationship between the parties which requires them (such as through an arbitration clause) to take disputes to a specific arbitral institution?\n2. If not, is the other party likely to agree to take the dispute to an arbitrator or an arbitral institution?\n3. Does the dispute concern a highly technical matter which would benefit from having a decision-maker with a high level of expertise in the specific sector or technology?\n4. Is the subject matter of the dispute considered arbitrable in relevant jurisdictions? Though most areas of IP are considered arbitrable in many jurisdictions, questions relating to validity or registrability of intellectual property are deemed as non-arbitrable in some jurisdictions.\n5. Is there a clear benefit that can be achieved from having the matter heard under procedural and evidence rules different from those of court proceedings?\n6. Is more than one arbitrator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a legal practitioner as co-arbitrators?\n\nThere is a wide range of arbitrators and arbitral institutions, ranging from public-funded bodies to private practitioners.

The hourly rate of an arbitrator would differ significantly depending on the amount in dispute and which arbitration/arbitral institution the parties choose. Due to the high legal and subject-matter expertise required of an arbitrator, the cost of engaging them can be extremely expensive.   \n\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center provides that cases under the WIPO Expedited Arbitration Rules cost around US$48,000 and cases under the WIPO Arbitration Rules cost some US$165,000  (48% of such cases involving a three member tribunal and 52% a sole arbitrator). \n\nWhile legal representation is optional, very often parties to the dispute would choose to engage legal professionals to give advice and represent them. As such, the largest portion of arbitration-related costs is likely to be legal fees for engaging legal professionals."

            "text": "Before you engage in arbitration, you should think about whether arbitration is a suitable dispute resolution method for your situation and which arbitration types would suit your needs best. \n\nSome questions to consider before you take your dispute to arbitration:   \n\n1. Is there an existing contractual relationship between the parties which requires them (such as through an arbitration clause) to take disputes to a specific arbitral institution?\n2. If not, is the other party likely to agree to take the dispute to an arbitrator or an arbitral institution?\n3. Does the dispute concern a highly technical matter which would benefit from having a decision-maker with a high level of expertise in the specific sector or technology?\n4. Is the subject matter of the dispute considered arbitrable in relevant jurisdictions? Though most areas of IP are considered arbitrable in many jurisdictions, questions relating to validity or registrability of intellectual property are deemed as non-arbitrable in some jurisdictions.\n5. Is there a clear benefit that can be achieved from having the matter heard under procedural and evidence rules different from those of court proceedings?\n6. Is more than one arbitrator required? For example, do the parties come from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds? Or would it be beneficial to have both a technical expert and a legal practitioner as co-arbitrators?\n\nThere is a wide range of arbitrators and arbitral institutions, ranging from public-funded bodies to private practitioners. Here's a list of directories and arbitral institutions that may assist you in finding an arbitrator/s you would like to engage:  \n\n The Resolution Institute's Dispute Resolver Directory list.\n The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO)  provides small business and family enterprises with information about dispute resolution options, access to mediation and alternative dispute resolution processes including arbitration.\n The World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center  offers mediation, arbitration and expert determination to enable private parties to settle their international commercial disputes. For more information, see WIPO ADR options.\n the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration.\n the Australian Disputes Centre.\n\nYou can also seek help from legal professionals to seek advice on whether arbitration or other forms of ADR would be suitable for your situation and represent you throughout the dispute resolution process. You can find a qualified IP attorney to assist you at: Find an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board."
