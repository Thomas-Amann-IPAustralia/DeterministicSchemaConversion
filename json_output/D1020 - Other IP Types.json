However, IP First Response contains general information which may be useful for the enforcement of all intellectual property. Consider exploring the enforcement options and whether they may still contain information that\u2019s useful for your situation.\n\nThis tool is currently in early-stage development and testing, aimed at determining its usefulness to rights holders like you. We invite you to provide feedback about this navigator tool, IP First Response, and your experience enforcing your IP through our [IP First Response feedback form](https://ipaustralia.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6LKlgPWZqiheCiy) and/or via email at [ipfirstresponse@ipaustralia.gov.au](mailto:ipfirstresponse@ipaustralia.gov.au)\n\nIf you have other types of IP, you might be interested in the following resources:\n\n* Geographical Indications (GIs) [Geographical Indications And Trade Marks | IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/what-are-trade-marks/kinds-of-trade-marks/geographical-indications-and-trade-marks) :\n* Wine GIs are managed by the [Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/agriculture-land/farm-food-drought/wine-policy).\n* [IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/understanding-trade-marks/types-of-trade-marks/other-types-trade-marks#Trade-marks-for-wine) is responsible for the registration of GIs as certification trade marks for all goods.\n* Specific enforcement mechanisms for spirits are managed by [Food Standards Australia New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx).\n* [Indigenous Knowledge | IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/indigenous-knowledge) or speak with IP Australia on [Yarnline](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/speak-with-us-on-yarnline)\n* Copyright and circuit layout rights are managed by the Attorney-General's Department in Australia [Copyright | Attorney-General's Department](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/copyright)\n* [Trade secrets, know-how, and confidential information | Business Queensland](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/risk/ip/ip-kit/browse-ip-topics/trade-secrets)\n* Some IP rights recognised overseas, such as data and rights to publicity or your likeness (\u2018image rights\u2019), do not have specific IP protection in Australia. You can learn more about IP in general at [WIPO - World Intellectual Property Organization](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html)\n\nPlease provide feedback about the IP type you\u2019re interested in and we will consider adding it to the tool in future. Thank you for your engagement with the tool."
