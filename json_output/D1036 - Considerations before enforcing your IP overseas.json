This consideration can be discussed with an IP professional familiar with the IP system in that country."

For instance, one lawyer may be highly experienced in dealing with multi-national trade marks, but not so experienced with patent licencing deals, or vice versa.\n* Once you engage a legal professional for their service, they are obliged to follow your instructions. While they can advise you on certain courses of action, you have the ultimate decision. Using a legal professional can lead to a false sense of security if you do not understand and pay heed to their advice."
