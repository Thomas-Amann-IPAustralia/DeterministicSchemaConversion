            "text": "It is important to understand what does not constitute infringement. Notably, when copyright protection expires, the material enters what is known as the \"public domain.\" These works can be freely used. \n\nThe Copyright Act also provides numerous defences and exceptions that enable some use of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner in certain circumstances. These exceptions permit \"fair dealings\" with copyright material for particular purposes, including: \n\n research or study32\n criticism or review33\n reporting of news34\n giving of professional legal advice35\n parody and satire36\n making accessible format copies by, or on behalf of, a person with a disability.37\n\nDetermining copyright infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise. Experts can help work out exactly what is protected by copyright and how it has been copied. Additionally, they can assess the available defences and exceptions under the Copyright Act that can affect the outcome. This guide provides a starting point, but qualified professionals should assess specific cases. \n\n[](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement?utm_content=from101_button_experiment_v1)\n\n1.
