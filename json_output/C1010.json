IP protection programs generally focus on trade marks and require a registered trade mark or a pending application with a recognised IP office. However, many platforms receive reports for other types of IP rights as well, and having an account set up with their IP protection program can help streamline this process. \n\nThese programs themselves are generally free or low-cost. While different marketplaces require different types of information, you will generally be required to provide proof of ownership, product images and contact details, then wait for the platform to verify your application."

Checking alerts and confirming takedown requests generally takes a few minutes per week. Conducting further searches, investigating listings, and reporting listings may take more time."
