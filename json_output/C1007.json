Gather evidence and factual details - Identify what you're licensing, including registration numbers, territories and any existing rights or restrictions.\n3. Identify relevant parties - Search out and understand who you plan to negotiate with, and whether others (such as intermediaries) may need to be involved.\n4. Review applicable rules - Understand legal principles around licensing, especially any obligations to maintain control of your IP and speak to an IP professional if you need assistance.\n5. Consider where you may use the assistance of various professional services and contact them to understand costs and other considerations before deciding."
