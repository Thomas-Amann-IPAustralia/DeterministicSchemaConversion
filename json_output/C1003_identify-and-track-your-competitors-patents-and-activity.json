      "articleBody": "Monitoring competitors' intellectual property (IP) and conducting a freedom to operate (FTO) search allows you to check whether any registered or pending rights could restrict your ability to make, use, or sell your product or service. These tools help you stay informed about relevant trade marks, patents or designs and avoid infringing on existing rights. Monitoring may be ongoing, while Freedom to Operate (FTO) searches are typically done before product launch or investment decisions. \n\nAdditionally, it should be noted that certain patent monitoring procedures are available through the IP Australia Patent Search tool (Australian Patent Search ). In particular, you can save a specific patent so that email updates are sent, if a new document is added to the dossier. \n\nYou can use the search tool to identify related patents. If there is a particular area of interest, you can also set up a saved search with a variety of search terms, classification marks and other parameters. This saved search can also be set up so that email updates can be sent if a new patent that meets the criteria (that is, falls within the search parameters) is published or granted.",
