This means that the fees will also depend on how much work may be required to establish your IP rights and to confirm that there is a proper basis for your suspicion that your IP rights are being infringed by the other party.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSome copyright owners could explore avenues for accessing low- or no-cost legal advice.

Arts Law also offers a\u00a0[template letter of demand](https://www.artslaw.com.au/product/copyright-infringement-letter-of-demand/)  for copyright infringement, which is free for subscribers and low cost (around $30) for non-subscribers. Arts Law can also provide advice on draft letters that use their template, or otherwise provide a referral to other lawyers who can assist in drafting a letter (though lawyer fees would apply).\n* The Australian Copyright Council (an independent, not-for-profit Community Legal Service (CLS) whose affiliate members include the peak bodies for Australian writers, musicians, designers, photographers, visual artists, journalists, film makers and architects) offers eligible persons (predominantly those working in the creative industries) free written advice ([www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/](http://www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/) )."

            "text": "Understanding what constitutes IP infringement, and possible consequences of contacting a suspected infringer, can help you decide if this is the right option for you.\u00a0\n\nIt's important to get all the factual details right and evaluate the merits of your claims before you send out a letter of demand, to give yourself the best chance of success.\u00a0**Making unjustified claims of IP infringement can have serious consequences. If you are found to have made an unjustified threat, you might be liable to pay damages/compensate the other party or you may be ordered to stop making the threat.**\n\nHere are some things you might wish to check and consider before sending a letter of demand and you should consider engaging an IP lawyer or IP attorney to work through these issues with you:\u202f\u00a0\n\n* The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where infringement occurred. For registered rights, this includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the alleged infringer has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices. For copyright, this might include checking any rules around registration in that other jurisdiction - while there is no copyright registration requirement or system in Australia, this is not the case everywhere.\n* Whether the other party's conduct amounts to infringement, having regard to\u00a0[what infringement looks like](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/infringement-101 \"Infringement 101 \"), to avoid making unjustified threats. For registered IP, it's worth considering the 'scope of protection' of your registered claim.\u00a0For trade marks, this includes the goods or services attached to your registration, and whether the other party is offering similar goods and services. For patents, it includes whether the product or process contains all the essential features of a claim in a granted patent. For copyright, you could consider whether any exceptions or statutory licence under copyright law may apply that could have enabled the use of the material in question without your permission. For more information about copyright exceptions, see [Copyright infringement | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/copyright-infringement).\n\nThe identity and contact details of the suspected infringer. It's important to send the letter to the correct party. You might wish to consider sending correspondence by registered mail,and keeping records to show that a letter was sent to a specific address on a particular date.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not sure about any of the above, then you should speak to an IP professional for help.\n\nBefore taking this action, it might also be helpful to consider your goals and potential outcomes, including:\u00a0\n\n* Whether there any other less confrontational and more informal ways to contact the other party before sending out the letter.\n* Options for outcomes that would benefit or be agreeable to everyone involved.\n* Whether you will be prepared to be engaged in further correspondence, negotiation or even disputes with the other party. If you threaten to do something and do not follow through, it could be found to be an unjustified threat."
