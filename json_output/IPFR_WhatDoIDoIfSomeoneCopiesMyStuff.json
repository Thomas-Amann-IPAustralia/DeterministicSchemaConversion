      "description": "When you think someone has copied your product, logo, idea or brand, it is called \u2018suspected infringement\u2019. The word \u2018suspected\u2019 is used because only a court can decide if infringement has actually occurred \u2013 but that doesn't mean you cannot take action.\u00a0\n\nDifferent types of IP are protected in different ways. You can only take action if your IP is protected by a specific right such as a registered trade mark, granted patent, certified design, or copyright.\u00a0\n\nIf you don\u2019t have formal IP rights, it may still be possible to take action, but it can be harder. Some legal protections may still apply under consumer law, contract law or common law\u2014but these usually require help from a legal professional.\u00a0\n\nStart by working out:\u00a0\n\n* What exactly has been copied\u2014your logo, invention, product, written work, name, style or something else.\n* Whether what\u2019s been copied is actually protected by a registered or automatic IP right.\n* Whether the use is actually unauthorised or illegal - some uses may be allowed, or may not amount to infringement under the law.\n\nIt\u2019s not always obvious whether infringement has happened. Even when someone copies your work, it may not be illegal. For example, your product might be copied legally if it isn\u2019t covered by a registered design or patent.\u00a0\n\nTo figure out what\u2019s going on, many people start by:\u00a0\n\n* Checking their own IP rights (such as trade mark, patent, design or copyright status).\n* Gathering evidence\u2014like photos, screenshots, or product listings showing the suspected use.\n* Looking at how similar the two things are, and whether there\u2019s confusion or copying.\n\nYou may wish to speak with a legal professional to assess whether the other person\u2019s behaviour may legally amount to infringement. Qualified experts for IP enforcement include lawyers who specialise in IP, as well as registered trade mark and patent attorneys.",
