      "articleBody": "Parties involved in an IP dispute can negotiate a mutually acceptable commercial or financial agreement to resolve their dispute. While negotiation between parties often takes place as a preventative measure prior to launching a more formal action, it can also be used at any stage during a dispute process.   \n\nParties can propose and negotiate commercial outcomes in different ways, including communicating directly in person or through correspondence, or instructing their lawyers to communicate on their behalf.   \n\nNegotiation for a commercial outcome is particularly suitable if you and the other party are involved:   \n\n- can have a discussion and make decisions without relying on formal procedures\n- want to maintain ongoing relationship with the other parties involved\n- want to find productive ways to resolve the dispute, which can benefit all parties involved\n- would like to maintain control over the outcome, rather than having someone hand down a decision\n- want to keep discussions confidential (if the parties involved agree that the negotiations will be confidential).\n\nIn deciding whether negotiation is a suitable pathway, you can consider:  \n\n- whether you can identify and contact the other parties involved\n- the other parties' willingness to participate in negotiations\n- when and where negotiation will take place\n- how decisions will be made and observed\n- each party's desires, needs and priorities in relation to the disputed issues\n- whether you will negotiate directly with the other party or whether you will be assisted by representatives or support people\n- what outcomes would benefit each of the parties involved\n- your next steps if the negotiation does not yield an agreement.\n\nSometimes, direct negotiation may not be the best way forward to resolve an IP dispute. This is especially the case if you have a difficult relationship with the other parties involved or find it challenging to communicate with the other parties. For this reason, representatives such as lawyers are commonly used.  \n\nIn some cases, having a neutral third party such as a mediator may help you overcome these challenges and facilitate an outcome, as opposed to direct negotiation (see - Resolve IP issues with the help of a third party | IP Australia First Response).",

            "text": "Commercial negotiations can result in a wide range of different outcomes depending on the parties' desires and specific circumstances. Some popular forms of commercial arrangements involving IP include:   \n\nLicensing \n\nYou can agree to a licensing agreement. Licensing involves the owner of the IP or someone else with a right to licence the IP (the licensor) giving someone else (the licensee) permission to use - but not own - their IP usually in exchange for payment. For detailed information on types of licences and licence conditions, see How To Licence My IP | IP Australia.  \n\nAssignment (selling or transferring your IP) \n\nYou may decide to sell your IP as part of your negotiation with the other party. This involves transferring the ownership of the IP to another entity (the assignee) through a process called 'assignment' so that you no longer have the rights to use the IP.  \n\nOnce assignment is completed, you won't have any control over the IP asset you have sold unless you have agreed that the assignee licence some rights back to you. The assignee will bear the risk of commercial development of the IP and be responsible for all costs, including renewal fees paid to IP Australia.   \n\nOnce the title of a registered IP right has been assigned through a contractual agreement, the transfer of the ownership can be recorded on the IP Australia register through IP Australia'sOnline Services portal.  \n\nFranchising (trade marks) \n\nIn a franchise agreement, you can give one or more parties (the franchisees) the right to use your trade mark or trade name, your business systems and processes, and so on.  \n\nThe licensed rights are typically used by the franchisees to provide goods or services to agreed specifications. In return, they pay royalties and fees. Franchisees often contribute to marketing costs for the brand as well. Franchising is a highly regulated area of law and you should consult with a franchising expert such as a franchising lawyer before agreeing to a franchising agreement. \n\nLetter of consent or co-existence agreement (trade marks) \n\nTrade mark owners can negotiate to have their trade marks co-exist in the market. This can allow both parties to use potentially conflicting rights in ways that both agree to (such as in certain geographical areas).  \n\nTrade mark co-existence agreements may take the form a formal contract stipulating rights and obligations of both parties, or a letter of consent where a party gives the other party (often in the form ofa letter ) consent to the registration of their right with IP Australia."

            "text": "It's important to get all the factual details right and evaluate the merits of your claims before you reach out to the other party. Here are some things you might want to check and consider before talking to the other party:  \n\n- The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where the alleged infringement/dispute occurred. This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the alleged infringer has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices.\n- Ensuring your claims do not amount to baseless accusations which would be seen as unjustified threats.\n- The identity and contact details of the other party - it's important to make sure you speak to the correct party.\n\nThroughout the negotiation with the other party, it can be helpful to remember to:  \n\n- Make sure you stay calm and professional throughout the conversation, avoiding emotional, accusatory language.\n- Focus on the issues at hand, not the personalities of the other parties involved.\n- Acknowledge that problems are often caused by misunderstanding or oversight, and that a mutually beneficial outcome can often be reached.\n- Be clear on the terms of agreement you reached with the other party, writing down the agreement in detail at the end of the conversation and making sure you enter into a legally binding agreement that reflects the negotiated outcome. An IP lawyer can assist you with negotiations or recording the outcomes in a legally binding agreement.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whether negotiations are a suitable option. An IP professional can help you make this assessment and advise what steps would work best in your situation."
