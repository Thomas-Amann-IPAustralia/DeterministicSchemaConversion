This is especially the case if you have a difficult relationship with the other party involved or find it challenging to communicate with them. In these cases, representatives such as lawyers are commonly sought to provide legal advice and assistance.  \n\nParties can propose and negotiate commercial outcomes in different ways, including communicating directly in person or through correspondence, or instructing their legal representatives to do so on their behalf.",

A negotiated commercial solution offers: * Potentially lower costs and a quicker  process, especially compared to other dispute resolution processes where you must rely on third parties (such as courts and tribunals). * The ability to agree to a creative, productive outcome that can benefit both parties commercially. * A much less adversarial pathway than legal procedures, helping you preserve your relationship with the other party. * A flexible and informal approach, as it is entirely up to the parties to shape the process. * Negotiation can be conducted across multiple jurisdictions. * Confidentiality, as the details of negotiation and the resulting agreements reached are generally not publicly available, allowing parties to discuss commercially sensitive topics freely."

If the other party considers that you are posing unreasonable aggressive or unprofessional terms for negotiation (not negotiating in good faith), it may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply. Some commercial arrangements may result in your intellectual property being ‘diluted’ by sharing the same or similar IP with others, which may cause damage to the value of your IP and make it harder to enforce it in the future. * If not handled with caution, it is possible that you may say something that undermines your legal position, which could result in less favourable outcomes if formal action follows."

This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the accuser has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices. * The identity and contact details of the other party – it’s important to make sure you speak to the correct party. Throughout the negotiation with the other party, it can be helpful to remember to: * Stay calm and professional throughout the conversation, avoiding emotional, accusatory language. * Focus on the issues at hand, not the personalities of the other parties involved. * Acknowledge that problems are often caused by misunderstanding or oversight, and that a mutually beneficial outcome can be reached. * Be clear on the terms of agreement you may reach with the other party, writing down the agreement in detail at the end of the conversation. It can be difficult to determine whether you will be able to leverage a commercially meaningful outcome from the IP dispute you are facing and if you can have a productive, amicable discussion with the other party. An IP professional can help you make this assessment and advise which steps might work best in your situation."
