If the other party considers that you are posing unreasonable aggressive or unprofessional terms for negotiation (not negotiating in good faith), it may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply. Some commercial arrangements may result in your intellectual property being \u2018diluted\u2019 by sharing the same or similar IP with others, which may cause damage to the value of your IP and make it harder to enforce it in the future.\n* If not handled with caution, it is possible that you may say something that undermines your legal position, which could result in less favourable outcomes if formal action follows."
