Therefore, if you use someone else's IP without permission, the owner may claim infringement and try to stop you or seek compensation.  \n\nBefore you rely on using any IP, it helps to check who owns it.

Licences may be free, paid once, or ongoing; terms usually cover how, where and for how long you may use the IP. \n\nIf you're unsure whether your planned use is legal, you may wish to speak with a qualified legal professional such as an IP lawyer or a trade mark or patent attorney. They can clarify whether an exception applies, such as the 'fair dealing' exceptions in copyright. These may allow limited use for things like research, study or review, depending on the context. \n\nPlease note: Even accidental use can attract legal consequences.
