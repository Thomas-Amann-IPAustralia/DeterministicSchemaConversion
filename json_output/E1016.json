Common forms of ADR include mediation, expert determination, arbitration. \n\nADR happens with the help of an independent third party and only goes ahead if everyone agrees to take part. Because ADR is private and tailored, it may suit situations where you want to keep a business relationship, control what information becomes public, or simply avoid the cost and stress of court proceedings. Outcomes may include negotiated undertakings, such as written promises to stop using the IP, or custom licence terms. \n\nYou can engage ADR through both public providers such as the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO), or private ADR specialists. Fees are set by the provider and are usually shared between the parties. \n\nADR is available for all IP rights in Australia and can be used at any stage before, during or after court action has begun, so long as both parties consent. If an agreement or arbitral award is reached, it can be recorded in writing and made enforceable."
