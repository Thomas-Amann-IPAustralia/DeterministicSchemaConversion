Someone reproduces the copyright work\nReproduction involves some form of copying. To establish infringement, three key elements must be shown:\n* The whole or a \"substantial\" part of the copyright-protected work has been used.Infringement can occur even if a part of it was copied. \"Substantial\" refers to quality rather than quantity. Even a small but important or distinctive part may be substantial. Courts will look at the entirety of the original copyright work and consider whether the quality or essential part of the work was copied.22\n\n* There is a connection between the copyright-protected work and the copied work.Infringement will generally be found if there was access to the copyright work.23Independent creation is unlikely to be an infringement.24\n\n* There is an objective similarity between the original copyright-protected work and the copied work.Courts compare the works to determine if there is an objective similarity. Literal copying is straightforward, but courts may struggle if the similarities are not apparent.25\nCopyright law will automatically consider copying to occur when a\n\n literary, dramatic or musical work has been made into a sound recording or film\n\n26\n\n or converted into digital form.\n\n27\n\n Additionally, an artistic work in two-dimensional form will be infringed if it has been made into three dimensions and vice versa.\n\n28\n2. Someone publishes the work\nInfringement will occur when someone makes something available to the public in Australia that was not previously available.\n\n29\n3. Someone performs the work in public\nInfringement will happen when someone performs the work for members of the public.\n4. Someone communicates the work to the public\nInfringement will occur if someone makes the work available to the public by uploading it to the Internet, for example.\n\n30\n5. Someone copies a sound recording, film or broadcast\nInfringement occurs when someone makes a copy of a sound recording or film and plays or shows it in public.\n\n31"

Notably, w\n\nhen copyright protection expires, the material enters what is known as the \"public domain.\" These works can be freely used.\n\nThe Copyright Act also provides numerous defences and exceptions that enable some use of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner in certain circumstances. These exceptions permit \"fair dealings\" with copyright material for particular purposes, including:\n* research or study32\n\n* criticism or review33\n\n* reporting of news34\n\n* giving of professional legal advice35\n\n* parody and satire36\n\n* making accessible format copies by, or on behalf of, a person with a disability.37\nDetermining copyright infringement can be complex and often requires legal expertise.
