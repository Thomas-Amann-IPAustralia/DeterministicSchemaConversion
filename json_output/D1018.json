Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, and which court hears your claim.  \n\nPatent cases are typically heard by the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed *intellectual property* as the cause of action, were as follows:~~;~~ \n\n* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months\n* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months\n* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1\n\nIf a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.   \n\nWhere appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.   \n\n**Time limits for starting legal claims**\n\nThere are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim.

You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.\n\n**Gather all your documents**\\\nBefore seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim.

It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.  \n\nConsider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim\\\nGoing to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes. \n\nConsider the impact of publicity\\\nCourt proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.\n\nGather all your documents\\\nBefore seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review."
