This may include general lawyers, IP lawyers, or specialist attorneys (such as patent or trade mark attorneys). \n\nHiring a legal professional does not guarantee that you will win a dispute, but it may give you confidence that your rights are being taken seriously and your next steps are well considered. \n\nHere's what you can generally expect: \n\n- They can help you understand if what's happening may be a suspected infringement and what options are available.\n- They may draft or review documents such as letters of demand, agreements, or court submissions.\n- Some are also qualified to represent you in court or at hearings.\n- Attorneys (such as patent and trade mark attorneys) are specially trained in certain IP rights and may help with applications, oppositions, or enforcement; though not all attorneys are lawyers.\n\nYou should ask early about the costs, timing, and what's included in their services. Some professionals charge a fixed fee, while others bill hourly. \n\nPlease note: Trade mark and patent attorneys are not technically lawyers, but they are qualified to give advice on specific IP rights under Australian law.",
