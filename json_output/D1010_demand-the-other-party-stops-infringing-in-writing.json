You can use this letter to communicate your concerns and demands. It's often one of the first actions taken if you are satisfied that an infringement is occurring. \n\nAn effective letter of demand will:  \n\n- Identify your ownership of the IP right (or the other basis on which you can make a claim if you do not own the right yourself - for example, if you have an exclusive licence) and whether you are entitled to make requests to cease infringement.\n- Document the infringing conduct, with written examples, if possible.\n- Specify the legislation under which your IP is being protected.\n- Clearly specify your demands - for example, that the party stop infringing your IP rights, return or destroy all infringing property, pay you compensation, or obtain a licence from you.\n- Give a specific timeframe for the infringer to stop infringing, return all infringing property to you, or pay the requested sum.\n- State that if the demands aren't met, you may take further actions to stop the infringing behaviour.\n\nBefore sending a letter of demand, you will need to be satisfied that the other party's actions amount to infringement and it is recommended that you speak to an IP lawyer or an IP attorney. There can be serious consequences if you send a letter of demand with no basis including a risk that the party you sent the letter of demand to may sue you. IP laws include 'unjustified threat' provisions (also referred to as 'groundless threats' in copyright law) under which you might be liable to pay damages/compensation or you may be ordered to stop making the threat.\n\nFor more information about what constitutes an infringement, see our information onwhat infringement can look like.An IP professional can help you make this assessment and draft the letter.\n\nPlease note that sending a letter of demand before consulting with an IP professional may result in detrimental outcomes for you and your IP right. Please consider carefully if you want to undertake this action and are fully aware of the risks involved.  \n\nA letter of demand will also usually be more effective if it is sent by an IP lawyer or IP attorney on your behalf, rather than you sending it personally.

This could potentially jeopardise your own IP rights.\n- For trade marks, it might also prompt the other party to apply for their own trade mark, which may then need to be opposed.\n- Sending a letter of demand might give the suspected infringer time to hide or destroy evidence.

This could include seeking damages or compensation for unjustified threatsor an order that you stop making the threat."

            "text": "If you engage an IP professional to give you legal advice or draft a letter for you, you will have to pay their fees.\n\nFees for IP professionals vary depending on the complexity of the issues at hand and which type of IP professional you engage. Fees to draft a letter of demand generally sit between: \n\n- For trade marks: $1,500 to $5,000\n- For patents: $1,500 to $10,000\n\nHowever, you should keep in mind that before drafting a letter of demand, it would be necessary to review relevant materials to confirm whether there is a proper basis for sending the letter of demand, because sending an unjustified threat could expose you to legal action. This means that the fees will also depend on how much work may be required to establish your IP rights and to confirm that there is a proper basis for your suspicion that your IP rights are being infringed by the other party.  \n\nSome copyright owners could explore avenues for accessing low- or no-cost legal advice. For example: \n\n- the Arts Law Centre of Australia (a not-for-profit independent national community legal centre for the arts) can provide advice to artists and arts organisations on queries related to their arts practice, including in relation to copyright (www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/ ). Arts Law also offers a template letter of demand  for copyright infringement, which is free for subscribers and low cost (around $30) for non-subscribers. Arts Law can also provide advice on draft letters that use their template, or otherwise provide a referral to other lawyers who can assist in drafting a letter (though lawyer fees would apply).\n- The Australian Copyright Council (an independent, not-for-profit Community Legal Service (CLS) whose affiliate members include the peak bodies for Australian writers, musicians, designers, photographers, visual artists, journalists, film makers and architects) offers eligible persons (predominantly those working in the creative industries) free written advice (www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/ )."

            "text": "Understanding what constitutes IP infringement, and possible consequences of contacting a suspected infringer, can help you decide if this is the right option for you. \n\nIt's important to get all the factual details right and evaluate the merits of your claims before you send out a letter of demand, to give yourself the best chance of success. Making unjustified claims of IP infringement can have serious consequences. If you are found to have made an unjustified threat, you might be liable to pay damages/compensate the other party or you may be ordered to stop making the threat.\n\nHere are some things you might wish to check and consider before sending a letter of demand and you should consider engaging an IP lawyer or IP attorney to work through these issues with you:  \n\n- The status and details of the relevant IP in the jurisdiction where infringement occurred. For registered rights, this includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the alleged infringer has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices. For copyright, this might include checking any rules around registration in that other jurisdiction - while there is no copyright registration requirement or system in Australia, this is not the case everywhere.\n- Whether the other party's conduct amounts to infringement, having regard to what infringement looks like, to avoid making unjustified threats. For registered IP, it's worth considering the 'scope of protection' of your registered claim. For trade marks, this includes the goods or services attached to your registration, and whether the other party is offering similar goods and services. For patents, it includes whether the product or process contains all the essential features of a claim in a granted patent. For copyright, you could consider whether any exceptions or statutory licence under copyright law may apply that could have enabled the use of the material in question without your permission. For more information about copyright exceptions, see Copyright infringement | IP Australia First Response.\n\nThe identity and contact details of the suspected infringer. It's important to send the letter to the correct party. You might wish to consider sending correspondence by registered mail,and keeping records to show that a letter was sent to a specific address on a particular date.  If you are not sure about any of the above, then you should speak to an IP professional for help.\n\nBefore taking this action, it might also be helpful to consider your goals and potential outcomes, including: \n\n- Whether there any other less confrontational and more informal ways to contact the other party before sending out the letter.\n- Options for outcomes that would benefit or be agreeable to everyone involved.\n- Whether you will be prepared to be engaged in further correspondence, negotiation or even disputes with the other party. If you threaten to do something and do not follow through, it could be found to be an unjustified threat."
