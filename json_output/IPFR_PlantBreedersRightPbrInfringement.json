            "text": "Where a PBR is registered with IP Australia, the following activities may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without permission of the owner:\n\n**1. Someone uses the plant variety**\n\nAustralian plant variety law gives plant breeders exclusive control over their varieties.7 Infringement occurs when a person uses a protected plant variety in ways that only the owner is allowed to do so and without permission.8 They could be using the plant variety in different ways, including:\n\n* **Producing or reproducing the plant material.** This happens when someone creates more plants of the protected variety. Reproduction here is the act of making more plants by growing seeds or using cuttings.9\n* **Conditioning the plant material for propagation.** This happens when someone prepares the plant materials for growing more plants.10 For example, cleaning, coating, sorting, packaging, or grading materials such as seeds, stems, and branches.\n* **Commercialising of propagating material.** Including selling (or offering to sell) plants or their reproductive materials, bringing protected plant materials into Australia or sending them overseas or keeping plant materials for any of these commercial purposes.11\n\n**2. Someone uses the plant variety name**\n\nInfringement can also occur where the protected plant variety name is used on other plants or varieties.12 Protection can extend to include a synonym of the plant variety name registered with IP Australia.13\n\n**For example,** if a plant breeder registers a new rose variety with the name \u2018SUNSPARK\u2019 with the synonym \u2018SPARK\u2019, another grower developing and selling a rose called \u2018SPARK\u2019 would be an infringement.\n\n**3. Someone uses an****essentially derived variety**\n\nPBR protection also covers plant varieties that are very similar to the protected ones.14 Therefore, infringement can occur when someone uses another variety that is considered too similar. Owners of PBRs can also seek to have varieties called an essentially derived variety (EDV).15 These varieties share all the essential characteristics of a registered plant variety but are distinguishable from one another. See information on PBR [\u2018Additional rights available\u2019](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/what-are-plant-breeders-rights/additional-rights-available).\n\n**4. Someone uses harvested material**\n\nInfringement can also occur if someone grows a protected plant variety without permission and harvests material from those plants (such as fruit or flowers).16 This can also include products made from material harvested from the protected variety (such as fruit juice).17"

            "text": "The *Plant Breeders\u2019 Act 1994*recognises that someone might unknowingly infringe a PBR. For instance, using a protected plant material without realising it was protected. Where a court finds infringement has occurred, it may refuse to award damages or to make an order for account of profits against an \u201cinnocent\u201d infringer.22 For a person to be \u201cinnocent\u201d, they must satisfy the court that at the time of infringement, they were not aware that the plant material was protected.23\n\nHowever, if the plant variety has been appropriately labelled to indicate its protection, the law assumes that the person should have been aware of its protection under a PBR.24\\\n\nThis makes proper labelling crucial for owners. It not only informs people about existing rights but also prevents infringers from later claiming they were unaware of the protection.

The variety has a distinctive flavour, appearance, and storage qualities. They have obtained PBR protection in Australia.\n\n**What would likely be an infringement**\n\n* A competing orchard purchases a few \u2018SweetCrunch\u2019 trees and uses cuttings to propagate hundreds more trees without permission\n* A nursery imports \u2018SweetCrunch\u2019 from overseas and grafts it onto rootstock to sell to local growers\n* A grower obtains \u2018SweetCrunch\u2019 trees legitimately but then sells cuttings to other growers without permission.25\n\n**What would unlikely be an infringement**\n\n* A consumer purchasing and eating \u2018SweetCrunch\u2019 apples\n* A farmer growing \u2018SweetCrunch\u2019 trees with permission from Crisp Orchards\n* Using \u2018SweetCrunch\u2019 in a breeding program to develop a new and distinct variety\n\nDetermining patent infringement can be complex and often requires expertise in both legal and plant variety matters. For infringement to happen, the PBR must be legally valid. PBRs can be challenged if, for example, the variety is not new, distinct, uniform and stable (for more information, see [What are plant breeder\u2019s rights](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/what-are-plant-breeders-rights) ).26 An expert can also assess the available defences that can affect the outcome.
