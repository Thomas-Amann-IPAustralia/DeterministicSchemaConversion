The arbitrator is often someone with a high level of expertise in the specific field of law relevant to the industry or subject matter of the dispute.\n\nArbitration can be somewhat similar to a court or tribunal hearing, but often are a shorter and more flexible version:\n\n* Parties are typically expected to produce evidence and submissions before the arbitrator to make a decision.\n* Usually, the parties to the dispute must agree before the process that the arbitrator\u2019s decision will be binding and enforceable.\n* Arbitration is generally seen as an efficient, impartial, and enforceable process to resolve both domestic and international commercial disputes, including IP matters.\n\nArbitration may be voluntary, required under a court order, or as part of a contract \u2013 arbitration clauses are often added to contracts, stipulating that the parties resolve future disputes using this method.\n\nArbitration requires agreement from both parties, which can be challenging to obtain after a dispute arises, especially in cases involving no prior contractual relationship. For this reason, where there are contractual negotiations, it is often advantageous for parties to consider including an arbitration clause in their initial contract."

The hourly rate of an arbitrator would differ significantly depending on the amount in dispute and which arbitration/arbitral institution the parties choose. Due to the high legal and subject-matter expertise required of an arbitrator, the cost of engaging them can be extremely expensive.\n\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center provides that cases under the WIPO Expedited Arbitration Rules cost around [US$48,000 and cases under the WIPO Arbitration Rules cost some US$165,000](https://www.wipo.int/web/wipo-magazine/articles/what-does-it-cost-to-defend-your-ip-rights-38493) (48% of such cases involving a three member tribunal and 52% a sole arbitrator).\n\nWhile legal representation is optional, very often parties to the dispute would choose to engage legal professionals to give advice and represent them. As such, the largest portion of arbitration-related costs is likely to be legal fees for engaging legal professionals."
