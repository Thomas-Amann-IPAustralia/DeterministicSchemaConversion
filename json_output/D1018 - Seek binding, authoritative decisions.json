It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.\nConsider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim\n\nGoing to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.\nConsider the impact of publicity\n\nCourt proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.\nGather all your documents\n\nBefore seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that you think might be relevant to your claim. You can give these to your lawyer to review."

At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed \n\nintellectual property\n\n as the cause of action, were as follows\n\n:\n\n;\n* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months\n\n* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months\n\n* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1\nIf a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.\nWhere appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.\nTime limits for starting legal claims\nThere are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim.
