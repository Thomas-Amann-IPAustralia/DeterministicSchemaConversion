This is called an \u2018IP search\u2019.\u00a0\n\nAn IP search means looking in free online tools called registers. These show who owns trade marks (names, logos), patents (inventions), designs (product looks) and domain names (website addresses).\u00a0\n\nFor:\u00a0\n\n* **Names and logos** \u2013 Use Australian Trade Mark Search. If you already have a logo and want to check if something like it is registered, you can also use TM Checker.\n* **Inventions** \u2013 Use Australian Patent Search.\n* **Product designs** \u2013 Use Australian Design Search.\n* **Plant breeders\u2019 rights (PBRs)** \u2013 Use Australian Plant breeder's rights search.\n* **Copyright** \u2013 There\u2019s no register in Australia. Search online, in image tools, or in industry databases.\n* **Website addresses** \u2013 Search the .au domain name register.\n\nYou can do a quick search yourself, but a lawyer or IP professional can do a deeper search and explain tricky results.\u00a0\n\n**Please note:** No results doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re safe. New rights appear often, and some rights (like unregistered trade marks) don\u2019t show in registers.",
