            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "At its simplest, infringement occurs when someone uses another's protected creative work or invention without that person's permission or consent. Australian law gives creators and inventors legal protection and rights over their work. Australian IP law protects various types of intellectual creations. These include inventions with patents, distinctive brand names with registered trade marks, unique product appearances with registered designs, various creative works with copyright, and new plant varieties with plant breeders' rights. Each type of intellectual property grants its owner specific, exclusive rights.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen someone exercises any of these exclusive rights without permission, infringement may occur. Infringement can be understood as the act of breaching those rights. As part of their bundle of rights, the IP owner can take legal action against anyone involved in infringement.\u00a0\n\nThink of it as using someone else's property without asking. Just as you would not use someone's car without permission, you should not use their intellectual property without permission either. IP infringement is sometimes informally referred to as copying, imitation, ripping off, or duping.\u00a0\n\n* [Trade mark infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/trade-mark-infringement)\n* [Patent infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/patent-infringement)\n* [Design infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/design-infringement)\n* [Plant Breeder's Rights (PBR) infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/plant-breeders-right-pbr-infringement)\n* [Copyright infringement](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/copyright-infringement)\n* [Unregistered trade marks](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/unregistered-trade-marks)"
