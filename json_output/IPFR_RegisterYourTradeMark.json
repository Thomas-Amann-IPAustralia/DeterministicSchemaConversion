Your trade mark will appear on a public, searchable database.\u202fThis may help you demonstrate your ownership if others allege you have copied their branding.\u00a0\n\nYou might have some rights to protect your trade mark even if it\u2019s not registered with IP Australia. However, trade mark registration makes defending your right to use your trade mark easier. It also increases your enforcement options.",

This could mean you need to reconsider whether your trade mark is right for you.\n* An Australian trade mark registration does not cover you in overseas markets.\n* Registration does not apply retroactively to past use, so it may not resolve allegations of infringement before you applied."
