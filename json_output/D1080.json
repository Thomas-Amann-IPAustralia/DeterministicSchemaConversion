      "text": "**Who they are:** Lawyers who specialise in IP law, which for some is regarded a distinct area of legal practice involving a focus on IP rights matters. \\\nIn Australia, \"lawyer\" is a broad term that includes both solicitors and barristers. Most individuals and businesses will engage a solicitor as their first point of legal contact.\n\n* Solicitors provide legal advice, manage disputes, and prepare legal documents.\n* Barristers are specialists in court advocacy, representing their clients in court.\n* An \"IP lawyer\" typically refers to a solicitor who specialises in intellectual property law and may collaborate with a barrister for litigation.\n\n**Qualifications:** All lawyers must hold a law degree, be admitted to legal practice in an Australian jurisdiction, and maintain a practising certificate. Solicitors and barristers are separately regulated and may also pursue specialist accreditation in IP law.\n\n**What they can do (for example but not limited to):** \n\n* Advise you on different areas of IP law, often including infringement, licensing, ownership, commercialisation, and enforcement.\n* Evaluate the strength or vulnerability of your IP rights and those of others.\n* Draft and negotiate legally binding agreements such as licences, assignments, confidentiality agreements (also referred to as non-disclosure agreements or NDAs), and terms of use.\n* Issue or respond to cease and desist letters relating to potential IP infringement\n* Represent you in dispute resolution processes such as negotiation, mediation, and appearances in lower courts.\n* Manage the legal aspects of an IP dispute and manage complex or higher court proceedings.\n* Help identify and mitigate legal risks associated with creating, using, or enforcing IP.\n\nIt's a good idea to ask for an indication of how much the entire process may cost during your first meeting. IP lawyers have a professional obligation to provide you with an upfront estimate of their fees and costs.\n\n**What they don't do:** Lawyers generally do not prepare technical IP specifications unless they are also registered as patent attorneys. Generally speaking, if your legal matter goes to court, solicitors will work with a barrister to represent you in court. \n\nBy engaging an IP professional, they will aim to provide their services to achieve your intended outcome - but they are obliged to follow the instructions you provide them. While they can advise you on certain courses of action, you have the ultimate decision and responsibility. \n\n**Where to find one:**\n\nTo find an IP lawyer, you can search on your State or Territory's law society website:\n\n* [Law Institute Victoria](https://www.liv.asn.au/legalhelp)\n\n* [Law Society Northern Territory](https://lawsocietynt.asn.au/index.php/nt-law-firms-by-area-of-law/)\n\n* [Queensland Law Society](https://www.youandthelaw.com.au/)\n\n* [The Law Society of NSW](https://www.lawsociety.com.au/register-of-solicitors)\n\n* [The Law Society of South Australia](https://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/PseudoCode/Radius_Search.aspx)\n\n* [The Law Society of Tasmania](https://www.lst.org.au/find-a-lawyer/)\n\n* [The Law Society of the ACT](https://www.actlawsociety.asn.au/find-a-lawyer)\n\n* [The Law Society of Western Australia](https://lawsocietywa.asn.au/services/find-a-lawyer/)."

      "text": "**Who they are:** Commercial services that track activity across marketplaces, registers, and domains to detect possible infringement.\n\n**What they can do:**\n\n* Provide alerts about similar IP filings, domain registrations, or suspected counterfeit products. These alerts may be automated, or reviewed by an employee of the monitoring service.\n* Monitor online listings and e-commerce platforms.\n\n**What they don't do:** Cannot offer legal advice if they are not registered lawyers, or file IP rights unless qualified as an IP attorney. \\\nSome providers only monitor activity and it's up to you to act on their results - and to verify if a discovered use of your IP is likely to be considered infringement. Other providers offer broader services such as investigating suspected infringement, or reporting this to online platforms. These services may be offered by law firms or attorney firms that may be able to offer a package of services beyond standard IP monitoring services. \n\n**Where to find one:** Search \"IP monitoring service Australia\" or ask your IP professional for suggestions."
