However, a freedom to operate search is more detailed than just checking if something is new - it often requires specialist help to interpret results properly. \n\nA freedom to operate search typically only searches patents, and does not include other sources such as published research papers or other businesses selling similar products: the search only focuses on patents on which your idea or product would potentially infringe.  \n\nA freedom to operate search does not give you a legal guarantee - but it may help you avoid costly surprises later.",
