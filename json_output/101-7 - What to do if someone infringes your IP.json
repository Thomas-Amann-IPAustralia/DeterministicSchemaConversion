The website provides information designed to help IP rights holders navigate IP infringement and the factors involved in pursuing various options.\nThere are a variety of options available across a spectrum.\n\nTake no immediate action\nSometimes, the infringement might be minor, unintentional, or not worth pursuing. Reflect on whether the infringement has a negative impact on your business and whether taking action could involve reputational risk.\nDirect contact\nA polite letter or email explaining your intellectual property rights and requesting that the infringement stop can sometimes resolve matters quickly. The infringement may be unintentional, and the other party might be willing to stop once informed.\nSending a formal letter\nA lawyer can draft a more formal letter outlining your rights, the nature of the infringement, and demanding that specific actions be taken to stop the infringement.\nAlternative dispute resolution\nAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) enables you to settle disputes with the assistance of skilled facilitators. Mediation or arbitration can resolve disputes more quickly and cheaply than court proceedings. They offer opinions, facilitate agreements between the parties, or provide binding or non-binding decisions.\nLegal proceedings\nCourts can address many types of intellectual property matters, and their decisions are binding and enforceable. Proceedings tend to be expensive and time-consuming, with the outcome never assured. However, it may be necessary for serious infringements or when other methods fail. Court action is generally seen as a last resort."
