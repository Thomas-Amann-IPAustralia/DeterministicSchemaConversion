If your design passes the examination, IP Australia will issue you a certificate, and your design will then be 'certified'. </p><p>Examination is often requested by the design's owner to secure full protection of their registered design. Examination can also be requested by a third party ahead of a dispute, usually where the third party wants to test the validity of a registered design. </p><p>If an issue is raised during the examination process, you will have the chance to respond to the issues outlined in the report.
