            "text": "Where a PBR is registered with IP Australia, the following activities may constitute infringement, provided they occur during the term of protection and without permission of the owner:\n\n**1. Someone uses the plant variety**\n\nAustralian plant variety law gives plant breeders exclusive control over their varieties.7 Infringement occurs when a person uses a protected plant variety in ways that only the owner is allowed to do so and without permission.8 They could be using the plant variety in different ways, including:\n\n* **Producing or reproducing the plant material.** This happens when someone creates more plants of the protected variety. Reproduction here is the act of making more plants by growing seeds or using cuttings.9\n* **Conditioning the plant material for propagation.** This happens when someone prepares the plant materials for growing more plants.10 For example, cleaning, coating, sorting, packaging, or grading materials such as seeds, stems, and branches.\n* **Commercialising of propagating material.** Including selling (or offering to sell) plants or their reproductive materials, bringing protected plant materials into Australia or sending them overseas or keeping plant materials for any of these commercial purposes.11\n\n**2. Someone uses the plant variety name**\n\nInfringement can also occur where the protected plant variety name is used on\u00a0other plants or varieties.12 Protection can extend to include a synonym of the plant variety name registered with IP Australia.13\n\n**For example,** if a plant breeder registers a new rose variety with the name 'SUNSPARK' with the synonym 'SPARK', another grower developing and selling a rose called 'SPARK' would be an infringement.\n\n**3. Someone uses an****essentially derived variety**\n\nPBR protection also covers plant varieties that are very similar to the protected ones.14 Therefore, infringement can occur when someone uses another variety that is considered too similar. Owners of PBRs can also seek to have \u00a0varieties called an essentially derived variety (EDV).15 These varieties share all the essential characteristics of a registered plant variety but are distinguishable from one another. \u00a0See information on PBR ['Additional rights available'](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/what-are-plant-breeders-rights/additional-rights-available).\n\n**4. Someone uses harvested material**\n\nInfringement can also occur\u00a0if someone grows a protected plant variety without permission and harvests material from those plants\u00a0(such as fruit or flowers).16 This can also include products\u00a0made from material harvested from the protected variety (such as fruit juice).17"
