Can have binding and enforceable outcomes in the form of a settlement contract or arbitral award.\n* Arbitral decisions are final and cannot be appealed, unlike court rulings, while mediated settlements typically align with both parties' interests, preventing the likelihood of further dispute.\n* Globally enforceable, whereas a court decision is typically confined to the jurisdiction of the country where the court is located.\u00a0Using the WIPO Center\u2019s services has the additional benefits of:\n  + Procedural assistance so the process is easy to navigate and use.\n  + Simplifying international disputes that involve multiple jurisdictions and languages."
