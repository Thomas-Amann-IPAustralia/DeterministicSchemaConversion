For more information about what ADR is, see IP First Response’s webpage available at: [General ADR Card](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/ADR).\n\nThe WIPO Center’s tools and services include:\n\n* Free information and procedural assistance services (sometimes called ‘[Good Offices](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/goodoffices/) ‘) to facilitate or submit a dispute to WIPO’s ADR processes. This includes providing support throughout the parties’ engagement with the ADR options.\n* An [extensive global database](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/neutrals/index.html)  of mediators, arbitrators and experts, including from Australia. This includes experts from specific fields/specialties: [WIPO Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Services for Specific Sectors](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/center/specific-sectors/).\n* Free [online case administration tools](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/eadr/) that allow parties to manage and resolve disputes remotely.\n\nADR processes offered by the WIPO Centre include: \n\n* [Mediation](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/mediation/index.html)\n* [Arbitration](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/)\n* [Expedited Arbitration](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/what-is-exp-arb.html)\n* [Expert determination](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/expert-determination/)\n\nYour dispute doesn’t need to be international to use the WIPO Center, and other international dispute resolution services are available in some countries. For more information, see [IP First Response webpage on enforcing your IP overseas](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/enforce-your-ip-overseas).",

Can have binding and enforceable outcomes in the form of a settlement contract or arbitral award.\n* Arbitral decisions are final and cannot be appealed, unlike court rulings, while mediated settlements typically align with both parties' interests, preventing the likelihood of further dispute.\n* Globally enforceable, whereas a court decision is typically confined to the jurisdiction of the country where the court is located. Using the WIPO Center’s services has the additional benefits of:\n+ Procedural assistance so the process is easy to navigate and use.\n+ Simplifying international disputes that involve multiple jurisdictions and languages."
