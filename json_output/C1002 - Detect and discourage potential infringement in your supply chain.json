For more information on engaging third-party services, see [Obtain advice to help manage your IP.](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/obtain-legal-advice-help-manage-your-ip)\n\nYou can adopt a light-touch program or scale up to a comprehensive monitoring regime at various stages of a product\u2019s life cycle, adjusting the effort as your risk profile or budget changes."
