            "text": "Courts can take a long time to resolve disputes. It usually takes some months and can take years to finalise the entire process. Timelines vary based on factors such as the type of court action, complexity of the case, the amount of evidence involved, which court hears your claim, and the backlog of matters before that court.\n\nTrade mark claims are typically heard by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal Court of Australia. At 30 June 2023, the age of active cases in the Federal Court of Australia which listed *intellectual property* as the cause of action, were as follows:\n\n* 95 cases (45%) under 12 months\n* 43 cases (21%) 12-24 months\n* 71 cases (34%) over 24 months.1\n\n**The timeframe is typically shorter if the matter is resolved through negotiations or a court-ordered mediation process.**\n\nIf a party appeals the initial decision, this will add extra time before the matter is finalised.\n\nWhere appropriate, parties may request a faster process to resolve their dispute, but this depends on the availability of a judge to support a faster hearing.\n\n**Limitations on how long you can take to file an action**\n\nThere are time limits that apply to starting a legal claim. The time limits vary depending on the type of legal claim that you want to start.\n\n* The limitation period for a trade mark infringement action in most Australian states is six years from the date on which the first act of infringement took place, with the exception of Northern Territory where the limitation period is three years.\n* If you are challenging a decision made by IP Australia, an appeal to the courts must be started within 21 days after the date of the decision. It may be possible to obtain an extension of time with the court.\n\nDue to these complexities, it may be helpful to speak to an IP lawyer about time limits."
