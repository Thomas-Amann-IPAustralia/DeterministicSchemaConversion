They can be expensive, time consuming and stressful, and the outcome is not guaranteed to be in your favour.\n\n**It is prudent to seek legal advice before starting legal proceedings. You will likely also need the assistance of a lawyer with experience in IP.**\n\nCourt proceedings for plant breeder's rights (PBRs) may involve:\n\n* allegations of suspected infringement of a PBR\n\n* challenges to the validity of a granted PBR (sometimes raised as a counterclaim in infringement proceedings).\n\nIn Australia, PBR disputes are heard in the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2). A court can determine if a PBR has been infringed, whether the PBR is valid, and make binding orders to resolve the dispute.\n\nPBR court cases can involve a search order (*Anton Piller order).* This is a court order that provides the right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. This is primarily intended to prevent destruction of relevant evidence.\n\nThese are only granted in narrow circumstances, including that you have a strong case, and there's sufficient evidence that important material might be destroyed. For more detailed information about an Anton Piller order, consider seeking professional advice.\n\n**PBR court cases are rare. This means there is limited legal precedent for judges and lawyers to draw on. This makes it harder to build a strong case, increases potential costs, and adds uncertainty to how a judge might rule.** \n\n[](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement?utm_content=NotSure_button_experiment_v1)"

It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.\n* **Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim**\\\n  Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.\n* **Consider the impact of publicity**\\\n  Court proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.\n* **Gather all your documents**\\\n  Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that helps to show what was sold, grown or distributed. It can be beneficial to organise these materials so that they show dates, sources, and how the suspected copying connects back to your variety, as courts often rely on orderly, traceable evidence. You can give these to your lawyer to review."

            "text": "There are some things you might consider before you proceed with legal action in a PBR matter.\n\n Find an IP lawyer for advice and representation\\\n  Court proceedings can be an expensive, time-consuming, stressful, complicated process that can have a serious impact on you and your business. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before deciding whether to start a legal claim and to assist you if you decide to make one.\n Consider your goals before deciding to start a legal claim\\\n  Going to court is usually a last resort. You should carefully consider what you are seeking to achieve and whether bringing a legal claim is your best option. An IP lawyer can help you to consider your best option to achieve your goals and give you advice on likely outcomes.\n Consider the impact of publicity\\\n  Court proceedings are usually public. You should consider what impact this may have on your business. Unless they're covered by a confidentiality order, evidence and documents used in court will also become available to the public and no longer be confidential.\n Gather all your documents\\\n  Before seeking legal advice, it can be helpful to collect any documents like reports, contracts, licences or correspondence that helps to show what was sold, grown or distributed. It can be beneficial to organise these materials so that they show dates, sources, and how the suspected copying connects back to your variety, as courts often rely on orderly, traceable evidence. You can give these to your lawyer to review."
