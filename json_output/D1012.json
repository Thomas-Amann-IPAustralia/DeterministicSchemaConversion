      "text": "**What is it?**\n\nHaving a qualified expert can help you navigate the complex system of IP enforcement. Qualified experts for IP enforcement include lawyers specialising in IP, and trade mark and patent attorneys. We refer to these experts as 'legal professionals', although trade mark and patent attorneys are not necessarily lawyers and may not be qualified to engage in legal practice.\n\nDepending on your situation, it may be necessary to seek advice from more than one type of legal professional specialising in IP for different rights in your IP portfolio and different types of enforcement actions (such as court action, which may require a lawyer or barrister with litigation experience in IP). \n\nIf you already have a trusted trade mark or patent attorney, you might talk to them about finding the right legal professional for your circumstances. Alternatively, you could search the [Trans-Tasman IP Attorney Board](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney/find-an-ip-attorney-or-firm) register as a starting point. \n\n[](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/navigator-tool-suspected-infringement?utm_content=NotSure_button_experiment_v1)\n\n**How about other types of IP professionals?** \n\nThe term IP professionals refers to a range of experts who can help you plan and manage your business in relation to IP, including legal professionals. If you are seeking advice on how to enforce your IP rights, and what might be most appropriate to your situation, you should seek it from an IP lawyer or other relevant legal professional.  \n\nIf you wish to obtain support for other IP-related aspects of your business, you may wish to engage services provided by non-legal IP professionals such as: \n\n* an accountant who specialises in IP marketing or commercialisation\n* a brand consultant\n* a franchise and export consultant\n* a management consultant\n* IP search firms\n* IP monitoring service providers\n* Government business support.\n\nIf you are a copyright owner who is a member of a copyright collecting society or a professional organisation representing certain kinds of creator or creative business, you could explore whether that organisation is able to provide information or another form of assistance in your particular circumstances."

      "text": "The total costs of engaging a legal professional will depend on factors such as their fees and the complexity of the matter. \n\nFor trade mark and patent attorneys, you can expect an average fee of: \n\n* $400-700 per hour for a [patent attorney](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney).\n* $1,000-2,000 total for a [trade mark attorney](https://www.ttipattorney.gov.au/for-clients/how-to-engage-an-attorney)  to file and register a single trade mark in one or two classes of goods and services.\n\nSome legal professionals offer a free consultation to assess what services you need and an estimate of costs.  \n\nIt's a good idea to ask your legal professional for an indication of how much the entire process may cost for the service you would like to use during your first meeting. \n\nSome copyright owners could also explore avenues for accessing low- or no-cost legal advice. For example: \n\n* the Arts Law Centre of Australia (a not-for-profit independent national community legal centre for the arts) can provide advice to artists and arts organisations on queries related to their arts practice, including in relation to copyright ([www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/](http://www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/) ), and also offers templates for some common legal documents, and\n* the Australian Copyright Council (an independent, not-for-profit Community Legal Service (CLS) whose affiliate members include the peak bodies for Australian writers, musicians, designers, photographers, visual artists, journalists, film makers and architects) offers eligible persons (predominantly those working in the creative industries) free written advice ([www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/](http://www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/) )."

Using a legal professional can lead to a false sense of security if you do not understand and pay heed to their advice."

For example: \n\n the Arts Law Centre of Australia (a not-for-profit independent national community legal centre for the arts) can provide advice to artists and arts organisations on queries related to their arts practice, including in relation to copyright (www.artslaw.com.au/services/legal-query-form/ ), and also offers templates for some common legal documents, and\n the Australian Copyright Council (an independent, not-for-profit Community Legal Service (CLS) whose affiliate members include the peak bodies for Australian writers, musicians, designers, photographers, visual artists, journalists, film makers and architects) offers eligible persons (predominantly those working in the creative industries) free written advice (www.copyright.org.au/legal-advice/ )."

Consider:  \n\n[](/node/208)\n\n Learning more about IP  and your specific IP type. Having some basic knowledge will help you to better understand the professional's advice and recommendations.\n Researching what your suspected infringers or competitors are doing in the market (including where they might be based and whether they have registered any IP rights) and being ready to share the results. This will help your IP lawyer or IP attorney to provide you with advice.\n\nFinding an IP lawyer or IP attorney\\\nTo find a registered Australian trade mark or patent attorney, you can search the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board directory: Find an IP attorney or firm | Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board.  \n\nTo find an IP lawyer, you can contact the Law Society in your state or territory:\n\n The Law Society of NSW\n Law Institute Victoria\n Queensland Law Society\n The Law Society of Western Australia\n The Law Society of South Australia\n The Law Society of Tasmania\n The Law Society of the ACT\n Law Society Northern Territory\n\nThe Arts Law Centre of Australia's website  indicates that it maintains a national referral panel of arts and entertainment lawyers to which it may refer eligible copyright owners where appropriate.\n\nTips for choosing an IP lawyer or IP attorney\\\nHere are some suggestions for choosing an IP lawyer or IP attorney for your IP:  \n\n Ask for recommendations from other business owners or members of your industry association.\n Ask how much you'll be charged and how long the service will take.\n Don't assume that all lawyers or IP attorneys specialise in the type of IP that you have.\n* Try to determine if you can establish a trusting relationship. If you don't feel comfortable sharing relevant information, it could be difficult for an adviser to work in your best interests.\n\nIf you think you may need to go to court to enforce your IP rights, speak to an IP lawyer."
