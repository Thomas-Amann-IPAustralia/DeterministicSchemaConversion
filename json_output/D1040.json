These 'intermediaries' might include manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, suppliers or importers.\u00a0\n\nSeveral intermediaries operate along a product's supply chain and can be used to help prevent infringement. If third party businesses are inadvertently involved in facilitating IP infringement, they may be willing to cease this activity once they are made aware. This could include stopping things like manufacturing the goods, stocking or advertising them, handling payments, repairing items, or delivering orders.\u00a0\n\nYou might wish to consider sending a polite letter, call, or visit in person to explain your rights, provide evidence, and ask the intermediary to stop production or sales. Clear, factual information can persuade them to cooperate.\u00a0\n\nThis approach is informal and voluntary, but can be effective as businesses generally prefer to avoid risks. In some cases, intermediaries may be liable for facilitating IP infringing activity, though a legal professional will be able to advise you on whether this relates to your situation.\u00a0\n\n**Please note:** If infringement is occurring on an online e-commerce or advertising platform, you can consider: [Stop infringement facilitated online | IP Australia First Response](https://ipfirstresponse.ipaustralia.gov.au/options/stop-infringement-facilitated-online).",
