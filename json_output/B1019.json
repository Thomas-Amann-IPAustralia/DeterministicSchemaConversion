The decision to take an enforcement action should be considered as part of your IP/brand protection strategy.\n* There is a risk that taking this action would require you to defend your own IP rights. The ruling might not go your way and undermine the strength of your own IP.\n* Using these procedures improperly can be considered a bullying tactic and may expose you to costs.\n* If you are successful in opposing registration of a trade mark, the denied applicant may appeal the decision to court.\n* If you lose, the other party may refer to that decision in their infringement claim, though Courts are not bound by IP Australia's decisions.\n* The other party may still take court action during the process."
