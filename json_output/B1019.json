This process requires you to submit your supporting evidence and argument as to why the trade mark should not be registered.\n\nThere are several reasons on which a trade mark application can be opposed, including (but not limited to):\n\n* Similarity to an existing trade mark\n* Being too generic or descriptive\n* Containing a connotation that is misleading and confusing.\n\nIf your actions are successful, the  other party will no longer have rights associated with the registration of their trade mark.\n\nObjections to the registration of a trade mark can typically only be raised within 2 months of its acceptance date being published. If this period has passed, you may need to explore other options.\n\nIf the application you wish to oppose is in the two-month window, you can file a 'Notice of Intention to Oppose'  before it becomes registered. The opposition procedure can involve either a written or oral hearing, or a written decision without a hearing."
