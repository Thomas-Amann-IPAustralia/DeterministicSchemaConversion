You can also monitor the market by regularly conducting searches on internet search engines or e-commerce platforms. \n\nCommercial monitoring services typically start from a few hundred dollars per year for one class of goods and services claimed and rise with extra classes or overseas coverage. \n\nIf you chose engage a trade mark attorney or IP lawyer for legal advice and taking further actions on the results, you may incur further professional fees."

A quick manual check can take minutes, but reviewing saved searches may become a short weekly task. \n\nUsing a watch service is quicker day-to-day, yet you still need time to review results and decide on any follow-up. \n\nActing on a match, such as lodging an opposition or a takedown notice, can add weeks or months for the process to be finalised."
