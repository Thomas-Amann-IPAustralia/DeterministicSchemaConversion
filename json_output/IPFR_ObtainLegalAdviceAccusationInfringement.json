Having a qualified intellectual property (IP) lawyer or a trade marks or patent attorney on your side can help you make sense of an allegation that your product, branding or content is infringing someone else\u2019s IP.\n\nSuch professionals can help:\n\n* explain the claim in plain language\n* assess whether, or to what extent, the accusation has merit\n* outline the full range of ways you may respond, from negotiating a quiet resolution through to defending the matter in court.\n\nDepending on your situation, it may be necessary to seek advice from more than one type of IP professional specialising in IP for different rights in your IP portfolio and different types of enforcement actions (such as court action, which would require a lawyer).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you already have a trusted lawyer, trade marks or patent attorney, you might talk to them about finding the right IP professional for your circumstances.

If an IP lawyer needs to engage a barrister to represent you in court proceedings, this will add to the costs involved.\n\nSome IP lawyers and IP attorneys offer a free initial consultation to assess what services you need and to provide you with an estimate of costs moving forward. The Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia provides a service for free consultations. That service can be found\u00a0[here](https://ipta.org.au/community/get-free-consultation/).
