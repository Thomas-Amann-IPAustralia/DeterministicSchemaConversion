If you already have a logo and want to check if something like it is registered, you can also use TM Checker.\n* Inventions - Use Australian Patent Search.\n* Product designs - Use Australian Design Search.\n* Plant breeders' rights (PBRs) - Use Australian Plant breeder's rights search.\n* Copyright - There's no register in Australia. Search online, in image tools, or in industry databases.\n* Website addresses - Search the .au domain name register.\n\nYou can do a quick search yourself, but a lawyer or IP professional can do a deeper search and explain tricky results. \n\nPlease note: No results doesn't mean you're safe.
