This can be done for any IP rights you own or have the right to sublicense, and may apply across specific products, industries or geographic areas.  \n\nDeciding to grant someone else the right to use your IP rights could benefit your business and may be an effective way to resolve various IP disputes, including where another party wants to keep using your IP rights. You can investigate potential licensees yourself or engage an IP professional to assist. \n\nTypes of licences can include: \n\n- Exclusive licences (you grant IP rights to only one licensee and can no longer use the IP yourself),\n- Non-exclusive licences (you grant IP rights to multiple parties and retain the right to use the IP yourself), or\n- Sole licences (you grant IP rights to only one licensee and retain the right to use the IP yourself).",

Getting an IP professional to draft the licence can help to reduce this risk.\n- You may need to monitor the licence agreement to ensure the other party complies with it.\n- Licensing your IP rights to others has the potential to reduce the uniqueness or value of your IP depending on the circumstances, including who you license it to and the licensing terms.\n If you exclusively* license your IP rights, you will no longer be able to use them yourself.\n- In specific instances regarding trade marks, if the licensor is unable to maintain effective controls over trade mark use, the trade mark can become vulnerable to removal for non-use.\n- In the case a patent has been licensed to an exclusive licensee - they will have the right to commence infringement proceedings. In some cases, the patent holder can also be added as a party to those proceedings, potentially leading to legal action or expense.\n- If you do not put in place arrangements to protect your sensitive commercial information (such as specific business practices or product features) during negotiations, it may be shared with other parties or misused by the recipient.\n- You may also need to consider the potential tax implications of the licence, particularly if you are operating in multiple jurisdictions."
