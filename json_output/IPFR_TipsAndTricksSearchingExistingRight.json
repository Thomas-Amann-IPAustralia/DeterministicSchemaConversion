            "text": "When you suspect or are accused of infringement, it is vital to understand if the other party has registered IP rights, and what they cover. This can be for several reasons:\n\n* Verifying that any claim to IP rights made by the other party are real and current, and they are relevant to the current issue.\n* The other party may have a registered right which predates your right, is similar to your right, or covers a specific area that your rights may not. For example, it would not be advisable for Pigeon chocolate to pursue trade mark enforcement action against Pigeon soap before checking the details of any trade mark owned by the Pigeon soap company.\n* The other party may have a registered right, but you disagree about the extent of those rights or how they apply to specific issues.\n* The other party may have rights which apply in other jurisdictions (i.e. other countries) which may be critical to choosing your approach.\n* Even if the suspected infringer is not the registered owner of the IP, they may believe that they have permission to use the IP. There may be an arrangement with a previous owner of a right, a distributor (who believes they are authorised to grant permission to use the IP), or other reasons they believe are legitimate (but may be disputed).\n* Even if someone doesn't currently own a right, their past use, ownership or use might affect what you choose to do now.\n\n**Searching, interpreting and comparing registered rights can be difficult, and seeking professional assistance may be a good idea to confirm your position.**"

These allow anyone to search for any IP rights which have been applied for in Australia and include considerable detail.\n\n**If you suspect infringement,** it is useful to search for rights held in the suspected infringer\u2019s name, business name, and any possible associates who may own a right. Additionally, it can be helpful to search for any rights relating to the issue and to investigate if the suspected infringer has a relationship with a rights holder (such as licencing agreement).\n\n**If you are accused of infringement** by an IP owner, be aware that many details about a registered right and its ownership are accessible within the public registers.
