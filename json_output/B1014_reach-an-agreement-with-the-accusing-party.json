      "articleBody": "Parties involved in an IP dispute can negotiate a mutually acceptable commercial or financial agreement to resolve their dispute. While negotiation between parties often takes place as a preventative measure prior to launching a more formal action, it can also be used at any stage during a dispute process. \n\nSometimes, direct negotiation may not be the best way forward to resolve an IP dispute. This is especially the case if you have a difficult relationship with the other party involved or find it challenging to communicate with them. In these cases, representatives such as lawyers are commonly sought to provide legal advice and assistance.  \n\nParties can propose and negotiate commercial outcomes in different ways, including communicating directly in person or through correspondence, or instructing their legal representatives to do so on their behalf.",

If the other party considers that you are posing unreasonable aggressive or unprofessional terms for negotiation (not negotiating in good faith), it may prompt the other party to escalate and resist, rather than comply. Some commercial arrangements may result in your intellectual property being 'diluted' by sharing the same or similar IP with others, which may cause damage to the value of your IP and make it harder to enforce it in the future.\n- If not handled with caution, it is possible that you may say something that undermines your legal position, which could result in less favourable outcomes if formal action follows."

This includes checking the status of your IP registrations, and whether the accuser has registered IP rights with IP Australia or overseas IP offices.\n- The identity and contact details of the other party - it's important to make sure you speak to the correct party.\n\nThroughout the negotiation with the other party, it can be helpful to remember to:  \n\n- Stay calm and professional throughout the conversation, avoiding emotional, accusatory language.\n- Focus on the issues at hand, not the personalities of the other parties involved.\n- Acknowledge that problems are often caused by misunderstanding or oversight, and that a mutually beneficial outcome can be reached.\n- Be clear on the terms of agreement you may reach with the other party, writing down the agreement in detail at the end of the conversation.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whether you will be able to leverage a commercially meaningful outcome from the IP dispute you are facing and if you can have a productive, amicable discussion with the other party. An IP professional can help you make this assessment and advise which steps might work best in your situation."
