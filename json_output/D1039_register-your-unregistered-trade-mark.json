It provides: \n\n- Exclusive legal rights to use the trade mark commercially (on the goods and services claimed).\n- Robust and universally recognised registration (within Australia).\n- Clear evidence of ownership date to support your claims.\n- Strong negotiating position for settlement discussions.\n\nSome enforcement options are only available if your trade mark is registered. These include the ability to take action against infringement under the Trade Marks 1995, and the ability to lodge an objection to imports of trade mark-infringing goods at the border under the Australian Border Force (ABF) Notice of Objection scheme. \n\nRegistration can also make it easier to commercialise and licence your trade mark, and for others to be aware that you claim the rights. Your trade mark will appear on a public, searchable database showing your claim and its scope."
