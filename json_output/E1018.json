The delegate may ask questions during the hearing.  \n\n**Process steps:** \n\n* **(*****For inter partes matters*****) File an opposition:** You initiate the opposition process by filing a notice of opposition with IP Australia and paying the requisite fee. Parties will then be invited to provide evidence.\n* **Request a hearing:** You request a hearing, or a decision in writing and pay the required fee. Parties will be invited to present written submissions to support their case.\n* **Hearing**: If you wish to have an in-person or virtual hearing, the hearing will be scheduled at least 14 days after the final evidence is submitted.\n* **Decision:** The delegate writes a decision explaining the outcome. They may also order one side to pay some costs.\n\n**Outcomes and next steps:** \n\n* The decision may uphold, refuse, or change the scope of the IP right/s in question.\n* **Appeals:** If you disagree with the outcome, there may be avenues to appeal the decision to a federal court or the Australian Review Tribunal (ART) depending on the nature of the decision."
